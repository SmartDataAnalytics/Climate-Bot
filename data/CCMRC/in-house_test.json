(2013) assessed low confidence in antarctic sea ice projections because of the wide range of model projections and an inability of almost all models to reproduce observations such as the seasonal cycle, interannual variability and the long-term slow increase. no existing studies have robustly assessed the possible future evolution of antarctic sea ice under low-warming scenarios."

(2017) investigated the impact of 2\u00b0c of global warming on precipitation over tropical africa and found that average precipitation does not show a significant response, owing to two phenomena: (i) the number of days with rain decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and (ii) the rainy season occurs later during the year, with less precipitation in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. the results from d\u00e9qu\u00e9 et al. (2017) regarding insignificant differences between 1.5\u00b0c and 2\u00b0c scenarios for tropical africa are consistent with the results presented in figure 3.3. for europe, recent studies (vautard et al., 2014; jacob et al., 2018; kjellstr\u00f6m et al., 2018) have shown that 2\u00b0c of global warming was associated with a robust increase in mean precipitation over central and northern europe in winter but only over northern europe in summer, and with decreases in mean precipitation in central/southern europe in summer. precipitation changes reaching 20% have been projected for the 2\u00b0c scenario (vautard et al., 2014) and are overall more pronounced than with 1.5\u00b0c of global warming (jacob et al., 2018; kjellstr\u00f6m et al., 2018)."

(2017) used this approach to assess observed changes in extreme indices for the 1991\u20132010 versus the 1960\u20131979 period, which corresponds to just about a 0.5\u00b0c gmst difference in the observed record (based on the goddard institute for space studies surface temperature analysis (gistemp) dataset, hansen et al., 2010). they found that substantial changes due to 0.5\u00b0c of warming are apparent for indices related to hot and cold extremes, as well as for the warm spell duration indicator (wsdi). in particular, they identified that one-quarter of the land has experienced an intensification of hot extremes (maximum temperature on the hottest day of the year, txx) by more than 1\u00b0c and a reduction in the intensity of cold extremes by at least 2.5\u00b0c (minimum temperature on the coldest night of the year, tnn). in addition, the same study showed that half of the global land mass has experienced changes in wsdi of more than six days, as well as an emergence of extremes outside the range of natural variability (schleussner et al., 2017). analyses from schleussner et al. (2017) for temperature extremes are provided in the supplementary material 3.sm, figure 3.sm.6. it should be noted that assessments of attributed changes in the ipcc srex and ar5 reports were generally provided since 1950, for time frames also approximately corresponding to a 0.5\u00b0c global warming (3.sm)."

(2018), undernourishment occurs when an individual\u2019s habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary energy required to maintain a normal, active, healthy life. in addition to undernourishment in the sense of insufficient calories  (\u2018hunger\u2019), undernourishment occurs in terms of nutritional deficiencies in vitamins (e.g., vitamin a) and minerals (e.g.,  iron, zinc, iodine), so-called \u2018hidden hunger\u2019. hidden hunger tends to be present in countries with high levels of undernourishment (muthayya et al. 2013), but micronutrient deficiency can occur in societies with low prevalence of undernourishment. for example, in many parts of the world teenage girls suffer from iron deficiency (whitfield et al. 2015) and calcium deficiency is common in western-style diets (aslam and varani 2016). food security is related to nutrition, and conversely food insecurity is related to malnutrition. not all malnourishment arises from food insecurity, as households may have access to healthy diets but choose to eat unhealthily, or it may arise from illness. however, in many parts of the world, poverty is linked to poor diets (fao et al. 2018). this may be through lack of resources to produce or access food in general, or healthy food, in particular, as healthier diets are more expensive than diets rich in calories but poor in nutrition (high confidence) (see meta-analysis by darmon and drewnowski 2015). the relationship between poverty and poor diets may also be linked to unhealthy \u2018food environments,\u2019 with retail outlets in a locality only providing access to foods of low nutritional quality (gamba et al. 2015) \u2013 such areas are sometimes termed \u2018food deserts\u2019 (battersby 2012)"
