post-treatment units are facultative ponds, composing the system of anaerobic ponds followed by facultative ponds (fig. 14.1). the removal of bod in the anaerobic pond provides a substantial saving in the area required for the facultative pond, making the total land requirement (anaerobic facultative ponds) to be around 45% to 70% of the requirement for a primary facultative pond (receiving raw wastewater). the existence of an anaerobic stage in an open reactor is always a matter of concern, owing to the possibility of the generation of bad odours. if the system is well balanced, the generation of bad smell should not be important, but occasional operational problems can lead to the release of hydrogen sulphide (h2s), responsible for obnoxious odours. if the sulphate concentration in the influent is lower than 300 mg/l, the production of sulphide should not be problematic (in anaerobic conditions, sulphate is reduced to sulphide). additionally, if the ph in the pond is close to neutrality, most of the sulphide will be present in the form of the bisulphide ion (hs-), which is odourless (mara et al, 1997). wastewaters with low ph values (industrial effluents or wastewater originated from a water that is soft, with low alkalinity, high acidity or without ph correction) may induce odour problems. as a result of the points above, the anaerobic-facultative ponds system

estimating the timing and magnitude of late orogenic or postorogenic erosion in the north alpine foreland basin of switzerland. mineral cooling ages demonstrate that the basin underwent 1-3 km of erosion soon after 5 ma. this erosion coincided with a decline in structural deformation in the swiss alps, and a doubling of sediment accumulation rates in surrounding depocenters. we propose that accelerated erosional unroofing of the swiss alps triggered isostatic rebound and erosion of the foreland basin after 5 ma. a projection of the isostatic rebound of the basin into the mountains suggests that at least 6.5 km of erosion should have occurred in the high topography of the aar massif. accelerated erosion in the swiss alps at that time is explained by an increase in atmospheric moisture driven by an intensification of the atlantic gulf stream at 4.6 ma. consequently, we propose that the changing erosional capacity of the climate triggered late orogenic to postorogenic mass

that mapping adaptations by using the core concepts of the framework reveals a broad spectrum of options where some actors appear in multiple functional roles as operator, receptor or exposure unit. most adaptations connect up in complex means-ends chains. all types of barriers are identified, but at different positions along these chains. this makes it difficult to address the cooling water problem with simple \"one size fits all\" solutions. the analysis shows that there are already some implicit adaptations that may be entry points for more explicit adaptation to climate change. however, the analysis leads to the impression that it might be very difficult to achieve an adapted cooling water management on the level of the whole rhine catchment. coming to the conceptual level there is the difficulty that the framework is very analytic in the following sense. already parson's action frame of reference (1937) is intended to analyze a unit act. this incorporates the notion of an \"atomistic\" action unit into which all more complex actions can be decomposed. \"simple\" adaptations may be part of more \"comprehensive\" adaptations. indeed, carefully investigation of prima facie single adaptations from this perspective is likely to reveal a broad bundle of \"atomistic\" adaptations that are linked together in a kind of \"molecule\". similar problems are known from the literature on policy classification (cf. steinberger 1980): policies are difficult to demarcate (when does a policy begin and end in time?, where does it enter the domain of another policy?, etc.), and classification schemes are known to depend on the frame of reference. on the other hand, there are further interesting applications of the framework. the terminology of the operator, receptor and exposure unit can be exploited to map complex actor networks. this could provide the basis for understanding adaptation conflicts between different actors, or used to measure transaction costs associated with the coordination of multiple actors in developing and implementing adaptation policies. the framework has also been used to classify and systematize adaptations (e.g., in eisenack et al. 2011). there is also room for promising extensions. parson's action theory gives a prominent role to the norms and values that shape social action. this is currently not addressed by the framework, but could - together with investigation of available means and conditions - improve the analysis of the institutional dimensions of adaptation. finally, the important role of uncertainty and time in adaptation suggest promising lines of research that give more explicit consideration to how stimuli and means unfold in time, along with the perceptions and beliefs of actors. these remarks illustrate the interdisciplinary potential of the framework, and are a major motivation for its design. although it is rooted in action theory, the components referring to climate change and to the causal effects of stimuli and actions provide a link between the natural and the social sciences. 20"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What kinds of intervention methods are not effective to avoid a

greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. it is conceivable that faster climate intervention methods, such as mitigation of short-lived radiative forcing agents73 or geoengineering to reduce incoming sunlight74, could be more effective. however, the multiple sources of inertia in the climate system, and in human response systems, make this questionable. an analogous problem of avoiding an approaching tipping point in an ecological system such as a fishery44 shows that once there is a reliable early warning of an approaching tipping point, it is too late for slow intervention methods to avoid it. even when a tipping point is unavoidable, mitigation action may still help. for example, the rate of greenland ice-sheet melt (and corresponding impacts through sea-level rise), even when committed to irreversible meltdown, depends on the extent to which this threshold has been exceeded75. when faced with most tipping point early warnings, adaptation to minimize impacts may be the most effective response, although maladaptive responses cannot be ruled out4. appropriate adaptation action needs research and will depend on the particular tipping point, but always relies on the

solar activity to millennial patterns that reflect changes in earth's orbital proximity to the sun. although these temporal scales may seem long relative to management contexts, interactions among mechanisms at various scales can catalyze rapid changes in climate. regardless of efforts to curtail emissions, ghgs will probably accumulate steadily in the atmosphere over the coming centuries, and these will interact with the combined cycles of natural change (solomon et al. 2007). just as unusual climatic events result when natural cycles coincide, so are interactions of ghg emissions expected to catalyze surprises in earth's climate, many of which cannot currently be modeled. we anticipate climatic consequences related to ghg emis sions to increase over time, although their expression will be amplified, attenuated, or reorganized by underlying natural mechanisms. the uncertainty of climate change effects increases with each additional decade into the future, a factor that must be considered when interpreting the output of models that project those effects. temporal perspectives are an important component of vulnerability analysis (table 2). temporal perspectives are also important for planning and priority setting (table 3) for adaptation to climatic warming, including the current year (relevant for ongoing projects), near to mid term (2 to 20 years hence; relevant

include contingencies for longer dry seasons, extended droughts, and extreme floods due to shifts from snow to rain. diminishing snow packs result in earlier reservoir inflow, so reservoir operations must adapt to a shift toward more water being managed as a hazard (flood control) and less as a resource (reservoir storage). additional freshwater releases to mitigate increased salinity intrusion

convective versus nonconvective/stratiform clouds, diagnostic versus prognostic parameterizations, single versus multiple hydrometeor species, and single versus multimoment characterizations. these issues are highlighted below and then the features of the ice-cloud parameterizations for the gcms examined in this study are briefly described. 3.1. overview in gcms, the atmospheric processes associated with convective clouds and nonconvective clouds are artificially separated into cumulus convection and stratiform cloud schemes. for processes such as cumulus convection and cloud microphysics that occur at scales smaller than the gcm grid spacing (typically 50-200 km), specific cloud variables are determined as a function of variables that are defined at the grid scale, leading to a so-called ''parameterization.'' most gcms (excluding crm-like frameworks described below) parameterize deep convection on the basis of a convective mass fluxes approach. in this approach, temperature and humidity profiles are adjusted to account for heat sources and moisture sinks directly induced by the convective mass flux arakawa and schubert 1974; gregory and rowntree 1990; tiedtke 1989; zhang and mcfarlane 1995]. important to note is that owing to the observed small spatial scales of cumulus convection, the influence they have on cloudiness and thus radiation has often been neglected with the main objective only being their direct impact on humidity and temperature via latent heating. owing to the large spatial scales of stratiform clouds, gcms have generally accounted for ''cloudiness,'' and its effect on radiation, via this part of the model's parameterization. studies have shown that nonconvective stratiform clouds (e.g., widespread precipitating anvil clouds and cirrus outflow) can be produced by the detrainment of condensed water from cumulus convection. such connections within a modeling context have been taken into account by coupling stratiform cloud and cumulus convection processes in gcms tiedtke 1993]. more specifically, a link is made by including the effects of convection on cloud generation (i.e., convective detrainment as a source of largescale cloud) and allowing dissipation of cloud particles directly during their formulation. this technique originates from attempts by arakawa and schubert [1974] to allow detrainment from convective cumulus towers to serve as a source for nonconvective stratiform clouds. in general, nonconvective stratiform clouds and their condensates are formed, maintained and dissipated by many processes such as small-scale turbulence, large-scale vertical motion, convection and cloud microphysical processes. therefore, any coupling between convective and stratiform clouds requires reliable parameterizations of microphysical processes within the model's nonconvective regions of stratiform clouds. when modeling ice clouds, several processes must be considered in cloud schemes: the formation (e.g., ice nucleation, water vapor deposition) and possible sedimentation of cloud condensates, the growth and interactions (e.g., deposition and riming, aggregation) and falling out of precipitation, the evaporation/sublimation of both clouds and precipitation, and possibly advection of the cloud condensates. owing to computational considerations as well as our incomplete knowledge of cloud-ice and related fields and their associated processes, most gcms utilize fairly simple representations of ice processes. figure 6 is a highly simplified schematic illustrating the most rudimentary features and considerations in these representations. it mainly distinguishes the highly simplified forms in typical gcm (e.g., figure 3) used for global weather forecasting as well as many forms of climate simulation (figure 6, left) versus a somewhat common next level of sophistication (figure 6, right). in the former, there is consideration of only a single species of condensate, ''floating'' cloud ice. in this study, we use the term ''floating'' to distinguish it from precipitating ice flux, but acknowledge that a number of climaterelevant gcms do allow their cloud ice to undergo sedimentation. processes within the parameterization, relying on the large-scale fields, lead to the development and dissipation of the clouds. in some cases, the processes are treated rather empirically, and are implicit, in others they are more explicitly represented jakob 2002]. important in this class of parameterizations is that a fraction of condensate is typically assumed to have grown to a mass/particle size large enough to be considered precipitation, and is assumed to immediately fall out, albeit it can moisten lower layers through evaporation in this fall out process. in such cases, the gcm typically carries two primary cloud variables, horizontal cloud fraction and cloud condensate mass, where the latter is considered floating cloud ice. such a formulation is also referred to as a single-moment cloud scheme,"}, {"qas": [{"question": "The sign on precipitation is positive for all three crops and is negative on temperature, indicating what?", "id": 9963,

for the other crops are mixed, with uniformly high elasticities being measured for both rainfall and temperature on sorghum. a test of model adequacy before considering variability estimates in the next section, it is worthwhile to test the adequacy of the panel production function models. the classical assumption of the random effects model is that the errors are region specific. the significance of a deterministic time trend along with the other stationary variables, raises a question whether region production function errors might also be time specific. if serial correlation was previously ignored, estimates in table 3 could be consistent but inefficient, with biased standard errors. since random region effects are identified in table 2, it is appropriate to test for serial correlation jointly with this information. baltagi and li present a series of tests for serial correlation that 12 are carried out jointly with various assumptions concerning region effects. their lagrange multiplier (lm) test for zero first-order serial correlation assuming random region effects, is the same whether the alternative is ar(1) or ma(1) (baltagi, pp.91-93), which is fortunate as we have no way of testing which is the appropriate alternative. for ar(1) serial correlation, a new specification of the error terms in equation (4) are as an ar(1) process with the null hypothesis is

property shown by the main microorganisms to organise themselves in the structural unit of a floc, which is capable of being separated from the liquid by the simple physical mechanism of sedimentation, in separate settling units. this separation allows the final effluent to be clarified (with reduced concentrations of suspended organic matter). the quality of the final effluent is therefore characterised by low values of soluble bod (removed in the reactor) and of suspended bod (flocs removed in the final settling unit). the flocculation mechanism, which in water treatment is reached at the expense of adding chemical products, occurs by entirely natural mechanisms in biological sewage treatment. the floc represents a heterogeneous structure that contains the adsorbed organic matter, inert material from the sewage, microbial material produced, and alive and dead cells. the size of the floc is regulated by the balance between the forces of cohesion and shear stress caused by the artificial aeration and agitation (la rivi'ere, 1977). among the microorganisms that constitute the floc, besides the bacteria and protozoa, fungi, rotifers, nematodes and occasionally

california, this study applied a simple low-resolution approach for estimating the adaptability of california's high-elevation hydropower generation to climate warming. substituting the estimated energy content of runoff water inflows and storage for these relatively high-head hydropower units and estimating seasonal inflow distribution patterns by elevation band allowed preliminary

to limited energy storage and generation capacities. energy spills increase dramatically under wet and warming-only scenarios with existing storage and generation capacities. more storage capacity would increase revenues but might not be cost effective. storing water in reservoirs helps shift energy runoff reductions to months with lower energy prices to reduce economic losses. more generation capacity also increases revenues by reducing energy spill. annual marginal benefits of capacity expansion are higher for storage than for generation. nevertheless, current storage and generation capacities give the system some flexibility to adapt to climate change. although the dry scenario examined in this study has 20% less runoff than the base historical hydrology, system-wide, revenues decrease by less than 14% through optimally re-operating storage and generation facilities within existing capacities. thus, current storage and generation capacities can compensate for some snowpack

(p. 28) a tendency for hazard/impact modelling to focus on an arbitrary and narrow subset of the multiple emergent dimensions of vulnerability seems to be a feature of past applications rather than an intrinsic limitation of the method. understanding the emergent nature of vulnerability and integrating appropriate interdisciplinary solutions is difficult. the pressure to respond to rapidly evolving policy demand has led to vulnerability being equated with a narrow set of mostly biophysical or economic impacts predicted using pre-existing modelling systems. selectively and arbitrarily equating vulnerability with default model outputs tends to create a relevance gap between this type of science and the types of information required to prioritise adaptation responses throughout society. a focus on narrow technical responses can overlook more transformative and holistic opportunities to adapt, and disempower decision makers by focusing on drivers of change beyond their immediate influence. there is an urgent need to broaden the application of hazard/impact modelling, and to complement it with methods capable of identifying and enhancing diverse and transformative sources of adaptive capacity throughout society. this review suggests that indices designed deductively from integrated conceptual frameworks have potential to illuminate the multiple and emergent dimensions of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. in the next paper in this series nelson et al., 2010 ), we combine hazard and impact modelling with an holistic measure of the adaptive capacity created using

intergovernmental organisations, including un bodies and the world bank and the international monetary fund. although these organisations might operate to increase the accountability of states, to whom the relevant international organisations are accountable is not always clear. also, developing countries are under-represented.20 diffi cult choices will have to be made by these institutions in

(fig. 5). the thermodynamic response to radiative forcing is best understood and most robust across models. examples include enhanced continental warming, polar amplification and the wet-gets-wetter

the mechanisms for circulation change is essential to reduce this uncertainty, but they have only begun to be explored. more research is needed on how aerosol forcing can induce regional atmospheric circulation change (for example, the asian summer monsoon). recent studies suggest that despite large uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing, there are robust planetary-scale response patterns, mediated by ocean coupling. with limited computational resources, it is critical to make optimal use of computing resources to advance regional climate change projections and to correctly assess uncertainties, reducing them when possible. there are a number of demands on computer and human resources (see figure). a variety of independent models, differing significantly in their underlying physics and numerics, is required to provide assessments of the range of possible climate change. models are also being developed that contain ever more complete representations of the climate system, including processes such as biogeochemical cycles, atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, clouds and convection, land processes and ice sheets. process-oriented experiments are needed to better understand model behaviour, including internal variability and the response to various radiative forcing. the following factors increase demands on computational resources. first, internal variability has a very strong imprint on climate trends even on timescales as long as several decades and spatial scales as large as continents81. this calls for large ensemble simulations96. second, when spatial resolution is high (25-50 km), many phenomena are reasonably well simulated in gcms97, including tropical cyclones63,91 and extratropical weather regimes such as blocking98,99. this makes higher resolution desirable. regional models are useful to understand the role of smallscale processes in shaping the regional climate response. these processes include orographic precipitation, snow-albedo feedback, land-sea breeze circulation systems, mesoscale convective systems, and ocean feedbacks on tropical cyclone intensity. orography and coastline geography unresolved by global models can introduce credibility into regional patterns obtained with downscaling techniques. such smaller-scale mechanisms need to be carefully evaluated to establish credibility100. we recommend the following modelling strategies to achieve more reliable regional climate projections. these recommendations contribute to the ongoing planning for the next phase of cmip and grand challenges of the world climate research programme: * to develop innovative experiments to shed light on atmospheric circulation response to radiative forcing, and to explore the sensitivity to ocean coupling, land surface

interestingly, one of the projects selected in the screening process is a storage project, where water is stored during the monsoon season and released in the dry winter, thus augmenting the low flows through the system. this is another example of adaptation, in this case to current and possibly future precipitation variability. the policy framework for environmental impact assessment for projects under the power development fund (nepal, 1999) contains no specific attention to natural hazard risk management, and it lacks a discussion of potential climate risks to hydropower projects. d.2.7 power development strategy (world bank) the world bank's proposed power sector development strategy (world bank, 2001) analyzes the key implementation constraints facing nepal's hydropower

rural access to electricity. for the latter, nepal should supplement existing institutional methods of delivering electricity to rural areas with innovative approaches, such as community based systems, presumably including micro-hydropower. one the other hand, the strategy points to the strong need for private investments in large-scale hydropower, but warns that \" factors such as financing terms (and their implications for tariffs), the creditworthiness of buyers, cost of alternatives and environmental impacts must play an important role in deciding the location of sites and the number and magnitude of contracts to be awarded .\" curiously, natural hazard risks to the plant and its environment are not considered in this list of factors. it could be that the strategy neglects these risks given that, ideally, the first screening of possible sites, as well as follow-up engineering studies, should include these considerations. in practice however, natural hazard risks do not appear on the radar screen of decision makers (except once a disaster occurs), and get less consideration than other factors that do appear in lists such as the one in this strategy. interestingly, the list does include environmental impacts. if these impacts were to be defined broadly, and would include not only the risk of the hydropower plant to its environment but also vice-versa, natural hazards would automatically be considered in the context of the environmental impacts analysis (eia). however, standard eia guidelines seldom include such considerations. in the

targeted in one of the sub-projects. according to the appraisal document, this huge irrigation system has been plagued by sedimentation during the flood season since its inception. given nepal's torrential and sediment-laden rivers, similar problems with sedimentation are one of the technical challenges for almost all irrigation systems. 31 there is a brief discussion about minimum flow requirements (for environmental reasons) in drought years. drought as a risk factor to hydropower generation also features in several examples of hydropower development in other countries (including

polarization in support for climate change mitigation e with democrats supporting climate action more when exposed to socially distant victims, and republicans expressing more support for action when exposed to socially near victims. the results suggest a promising method of encouraging support for action among some political conservatives, by highlighting the potential impacts on those who are socially close to them. however, it must be noted that although the pattern of effects was consistent irrespective of whether the socially distant victim was from france or georgia, spatial distance is still confounded with this manipulation of social distance. more research is needed in order to identify why these effects emerged, and indeed whether such effects would occur across different forms of social distance (e.g., ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status). for example, to further investigate the effects of different forms of social distance, and to eliminate the spatial confound, it would be interesting to manipulate the social distance of a victim in terms of their socioeconomic status or ethnicity, while keeping the geographic location constant. in addition, investigating why these disparities emerge along ideological lines will help to inform the optimal framing of climate change outcomes e an issue to which we return later. 4.5. mutual in fl uences between dimensions of psychological distance analyzing the in fl uence of each dimension of psychological distance in isolation is illustrative, but of course simplistic given that the dimensions themselves overlap. for example, an event that is temporally distant is necessarily hypothetically distant because there is always a chance that the event will not happen. similarly, spatial and social distance can often be intertwined (e.g., socially close people tend to be people spatially close to us, and spatial closeness causes social closeness; priest sawyer, 1967 ). several fi ndings point to this mutual in fl uence between dimensions. for example, fi nding that people perceive the effects of climate change to be more severe in geographically distant areas suggests that spatial and social dimensions can act in concert to increase perceived psychological distance. moreover, because these severe climate change impacts are statistically less probable than minor impacts, they are likely to be perceived as more hypothetically distant thereby again increasing the overall psychological distance from the self. the fi ndings of research speci fi cally examining psychological distance in the domain of environmental problems gifford et al., 2009; spence et al., 2012; uzzell, 2000 support the idea that hypothetical distance may feed into perceptions of greater spatial, social and temporal distance for these outcomes. that is, severe impacts, which are less probable, are consistently perceived as occurring in distant locations in these studies. as uncertainty is inherent any discussion of climate change newell pitman, 2010 ), it may lead to inaction both because climate change may be perceived as too distant to be linked to local mitigation actions, and because it reinforces perceptions of greater temporal, social and spatial distance. 5. reconciling personal experience and psychological distance our review of the literature on the effects of personal experience of weather and climate change-related events suggests that one way to potentially increase support for climate action is to decrease perceived psychological distance. in contrast, the results of studies measuring and manipulating psychological distance present a more nuanced picture. psychological proximity does not always lead to increases in belief, concern and action. to shed light on this contrasting pattern of fi ndings, in this section we identify several important differences between studies of psychological distance and the effects of personally experiencing extreme weather and climate-change related events. then, we discuss when alignment is found and identify potential moderators that may explain discrepancies that arise. we conclude that the key drivers of these discrepancies appear to be existing beliefs, values and group norms. we identify other key considerations for framing the psychological distance of climate change, including the potential for reduced distance to provoke emotional reactions. 5.1. how personal experience and psychological distance diverge when comparing studies of personal experience and psychological distance, one key dimension that may in fl uence decisions is motivational relevance. when the distance of a decision or outcome is manipulated in the lab (e.g., fujita, eyal, chaiken, trope, liberman, 2008 ), the distance is likely to be chosen to be far enough to induce different ways of perceiving the event, yet near enough for the choice to remain relevant. yet with climate change, temporal distance can extend well beyond one's lifetime. thus, in contrast to deciding, for example, about an item you will purchase now versus in three months, climate change impacts may be perceived at such a distance that they may become irrelevant to ' present-biased ' decision making. if one believes that sea levels will rise, inundating coastal cities, but not for hundreds of years, concern about climate change and sea level rise may not be a relevant factor in one's (current) decision making. other dimensions of psychological distance can be positively associated with willingness to act on climate change, with greater perceptions of spatial distance linked to greater willingness to act spence et al., 2012 ). comparing how the emerging literature on the psychological distance of climate change diverges from classic work on psychological distance may also help to illuminate relationships between distance, concern and action. in typical studies of psychological distance it is often the distance of the decision rather than the outcome that is manipulated (e.g., liberman trope, 1998 ). in contrast, when making a choice today about how to travel to work it is the distance of the salient outcome (e.g., the immediate convenience of taking the car versus the long term health and environmental bene fi ts of riding a bicycle) and not the decision (e.g., a decision you make today vs. in three months), that varies. investigating how the psychological distance of outcomes and the psychological distance of decisions themselves, may differentially affect choices and motivation appears fruitful for delineating the role that psychological distance and personal experience play in in fl uencing concern and action on climate change (cf. hardisty weber, 2009 ). in research considering the psychological distance of climate change the omnipresence of uncertainty also makes the nature of distance on any other dimension distinct from that usually studied in other research. studies of psychological distance typically manipulate distances that can be objectively known, for example measuring people's preferences about objects or events at a given distance from their house, or a speci fi c number of months away, or to people at a given position in their social network (e.g., maglio, trope, liberman, 2012 ). in contrast, in the context of climate change almost all information about the distance of climate change in temporal, spatial and social domains is imbued with uncertainty, and often not objectively quanti fi able uncertainty. for example,"}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was

individuals to disperse to suitable places is not solely a function of their inherent dispersal capacity. in many cases the landscape through which species must move to reach suitable places has been increasingly fragmented by human actions. this fragmentation breaks habitat connectivity, imposes barriers to dispersal, and creates a landscape mosaic of suitable, less suitable, and unsuitable

faculty. the data indicate that white faculty retention is greater where racial climate is more negative (final b -0.05). similar to results for faculty of color, institutional characteristics or status adds to the predictive power of the equation; in the experiences of white faculty, institutional characteristics account for 2% of the variance in faculty persistence. in other words, part of the reason for the differences in retention rates among faculty can be explained by the characteristics of their home institutions. thus, it is noteworthy that a negative racial climate may actually benefit white faculty in determining retention outcomes. discussion, conclusions, and implications so often we discuss disadvantage and underrepresentation without mentioning their corollaries--privilege and overrepresentation. mocking this normative social failure to acknowledge systematic advantages afforded to the dominant racial group, tim wise (2005) has pointed out that there cannot be an \"up\" without a \"down,\" an \"in\" without an \"out,\" a \"bottom\" without a \"top.\" several studies have explored the challenges and barriers facing faculty of color in the academy, as this study set out to do, while hardly acknowledging the privileges afforded to white faculty in the process. as such, the discussion must be expanded to include and place greater emphasis on how white faculty benefit from institutional racism irrespective of whether they are consciously aware of or actively support racist attitudes/practices/policies (bonilla-silva, 2003; chesler crowfoot, 2000). in this study, the notion of privilege is most prominently reflected in the relationship between racial climate with both retention and satisfaction across different groups. results from this national study of full-time faculty indicate that not only does a negative racial climate impede job satisfaction for faculty of color, but conversely, a negative racial climate is also associated with greater retention for white faculty. together, these finding highlight the notion that racial hierarchy and advantage can be perpetuated without malicious intent. although the needs of faculty of color and white faculty differ in significant ways, they are in many respects fundamentally similar. the results indicate that while the impact of racial climate on retention and satisfaction is different, faculty of color and white faculty both benefit from higher salaries, greater autonomy and independence, and having one's research valued by colleagues, but are deterred by the promotion process (see table 4). however, in keeping with a critical race theory framework, we recognize that while these values are held in common racial climate and faculty retention 555 regardless of race, they are expressed and experienced by faculty of color and white faculty in profoundly different ways. the disparity in retention rates for faculty of color and white faculty, therefore, may be a function of having the privilege to define what is valued and how excellence is measured. for instance, white faculty have the advantage of being defined and evaluated as autonomous individuals; meanwhile, faculty of color often experience the pressure of knowing that one's victories and failures will be taken to represent one's entire racial/ethnic category (turner et al., 1999). it is well documented in the literature that faculty of color are more likely to pursue research related to issues of race and gender inequities and social justice. white faculty, who have historically dominated the power brokers of higher education institutions, are more likely to fit into and perpetuate previously defined research agendas and values. relative to non-white faculty, they tend to produce scholarship on topics solicited by top tier journals and reach wider audiences of concern in the process. research indicates for many faculty of color, the standards required for tenure proceed down one path, while their personal interests and agendas may follow another. subsequently, as discussed previously, faculty of color are forced to find ways to straddle both successfully, lest they get pushed out of the academy. while there is great value in looking at faculty of color in the aggregate, given the common experience of otherness, we gain a deeper understanding of the needs of specific groups by viewing them separately. for example, the racial climate variable drops out of the faculty of color regression equation at step 3, indicating that the positive association between racial climate and retention can be explained by the ways in which scholarship is evaluated, the autonomy and independence an individual enjoys, and the review and promotion process. however, disaggregating the faculty of color category reveals a lasting negative impact of a hostile racial climate on job satisfaction for black and latina/o faculty that goes beyond autonomy, appreciation afforded in research endeavors, and the promotion process. this does not appear to be the case for asian faculty. thus, when grouping faculty of color together, there is a danger of overlooking the unique circumstances and needs of specific groups. this study sheds light on complex factors contributing to faculty of color satisfaction and retention--both in the aggregate and disaggregated for blacks, asians, and latina/os. among the key factors identified are perceptions of campus racial climate, autonomy and independence, review and promotion process, and having one's research valued by colleagues in the department. the literature has tied these issues to racial inequity in the academy. nonetheless, it must be noted our results 556 the journal of higher education remain a conservative estimate of the negative impact of racial climate on faculty experiences. rather than indicating a negative racial climate is not detrimental to the retention of faculty of color, our findings suggest faculty of color who remained in the academy have found ways to deal with (perhaps through transformative resistance3) the oppressive space a hostile climate can create. what is not accounted for are the experiences of those faculty of color who have already left the academy, quite possibly due to issues resulting from a hostile racial climate. future studies should also examine the factors leading to the attrition of faculty of color. the present findings, however, reveal how faculty of color may overcome a negative racial climate and also suggest tangible steps to be taken by institutional leaders concerned with improving faculty of color retention. for instance, the negative impact of the promotion and tenure process on retention and job satisfaction for faculty of color and white faculty speaks to the need to reform the traditional reward structure of the academy. a starting point may be to reexamine the value placed on mainstream journals and traditional forms of research in the promotion process. considering how autonomy and feeling that one's research is valued are key factors to retaining faculty, a new look at what constitutes valuable research is needed. furthermore, the involvement of faculty of color in evaluating such research and rethinking the promotion and tenure process are essential if efforts to recruit, retain and support faculty of color are to lead to substantive change. while institutional transformation is a slow and difficult process, the alternatives of failing to retain faculty of color and preserving a hostile racial climate are far more detrimental. understanding the factors involved in broaching such change is the first step in the process of achieving greater equity in our society. racial climate and faculty retention 557"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is one reason the equilibrium water table is a useful conceptual tool?", "id": 11850, "answers": [{"text": "first, it

many sites in the eastern part of the country, as well as in closed basins and mountainous valleys in the west, the water table is shallow, lying within 5 m of the land surface. thus there is a potential for the water table to anchor the soil moisture patterns in these regions. in other parts of the country, primarily in the west, the water table can be very deep and thus relatively disconnected from soil moisture. this large spatial variation in water table depth across the continent underscores the difficulty, from a modeling perspective, of correctly representing soil drainage with a single uniform soil depth. temporally, we observe a strong seasonal cycle and significant interannual variability, at most sites. in addition, upward and downward fluctuations in water table depth at event and diurnal timescales reflect the balance between vertical drainage, lateral subsurface flow to local streams, and the upward flux to feed evapotranspiration. the longer timescales of the lateral processes, as well as the inertia provided by the large groundwater reservoir, have a potential for increasing soil moisture memory. while providing the best available direct observational coverage, water table observations are still scattered and sparse in most areas. our findings point to the lack of, and hence the need to improve, large-scale and long-term water table observations, as well as the need to extend our hydrologic database deeper into the earth's crust. for now, we use a simple two-dimensional groundwater flow model, constrained by the usgs observations, to construct an equilibrium water table as a means for synthesizing and interpolating between the measurements. this equilibrium water table is a useful conceptual and practical tool, for two reasons. first, it brings out more clearly the first-order spatial variability in water table depth across the continent that results from the long-term balance between large-scale climatic and geologic forcing. it illustrates how the water table depth at any location is a function of both the vertical, climate-induced flux and the lateral, geologically controlled divergence/convergence of surface and subsurface

table provides a means of estimating the parameters needed for modeling groundwater flow, such as hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic connection between the groundwater and the rivers. these hydraulic parameters are linked to the hydrologic equilibrium in a given climatic and geologic setting, enabling us to estimate them from the equilibrium water table using inverse methods. in the next paper, part 2, we incorporate the water table dynamics in a climate model and explicitly investigate the role of the groundwater reservoir as a driver of soil moisture at continental scales.

real issues when making ethical choices and orient the discussion toward what matters to people. i contend that those who believe that the current generation should take immediate and decisive action against climate change need to go beyond arguing for a low discount rate. otherwise, the case for action crucially depends on asking the current generation to make 11 substantial sacrifices for cushioning consumption losses to future generations that are much better off than us anyway. this will not be very popular once voters understand what they are being asked to do. it will be even less popular when critics point out that the very favourable benefit-cost ratios of action presented by the stern review diminish and even turn negative with different, and a priori no less valid, assumptions about the components of the discount rate. fortunately, few people would want the future to be worse off than us or would want to violate the inalienable rights of future generations. they are also possibly willing to sacrifice quite a bit for preventing this from happening. hence, if one can convince voters and politicians of the case for non-substitutability, then there is a much better chance of gathering enough support for the measures described in the stern review to keep the world within the 450-550 ppm threshold. i also contend that the non-substitutability issue is much closer to the real concerns of people. by contrast, cba studies of climate change and the debate on the discount rate are strangely out of touch with reality. voters and politicians who favour decisive and urgent action surely do not do so because they want to save much better off future generations from some consumption loss that, even if it happened, would still leave them much better off than us. instead, they are concerned that climate change is like no other and that its sheer scale and extent of damage threatens to create a new bio-physical world that either leaves the future worse off or violates their inalienable rights, despite consumption growth. it may come as a surprise to some economists, but article 2 of the united nations framework convention on climate change calls for 'stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system', not for maximizing the present discounted value of an inter-temporal social welfare function. 12 that limiting climate change is costly is no reason against action. however, if we are going to ask people to make substantial sacrifices for

surface fluxes in several ways. first, they can modify the surface albedo (the fraction of solar radiation that is reflected), thereby changing the energy balance and the surface temperature. this, in turn, affects how the surface cools itself, by shifting the balance between sensible heat loss (the cooling of a warm surface by the wind) and latent heat loss (cooling through evapotranspiration). finally, vegetative height and density affect the roughness of the land surface, which itself influences the mixing of air close to the ground. rough surfaces mix air more efficiently, enhancing both cooling processes. changes in albedo, surface roughness, and the ratio between sensible and latent heat loss can all affect surface fluxes and, as a result, modify the climate. much of the world's

after the emission reduction has been achieved. while this leads to maximum \"environmental integrity\" because only emission reductions that have already been verifi ed are sold, it might bring about problems in practice. national programs to address deforestation might prove quite costly, and up-front fi nancing might be essential. therefore, it is proposed that the host government could sell options to the carbon credits at a fi xed price, with revenues being used for program implementation. provided the program is successful, investorcountry governments or companies could then elect to buy the actual credits at a guaranteed strike price. in order to reduce the risk of promising emission reductions that may then not materialize, the host country could limit the sale of options to a certain fraction of the emission savings that the program is expected to achieve. revenues from the actual sale of credits could then be dedicated to further emission reduction. a \"revolving fund\" would thereby be established and would help to solve the \"chicken and egg\" problem. the guaranteed price of exercising the option would also pose a \"price cap\" for the investor government for credits to be acquired under the kp. a price cap, in the context of deforestation avoidance, has also been proposed by schlamadinger et al (2001). the option price could be seen as an \"insurance premium\" for governments and companies against possible non-compliance. another alternative to ex-post crediting after the end of the commitment period would be to allow the host country to sell credits immediately after the monitoring of deforestation has been completed for the fi rst year of a commitment period. it would be up to the host country to determine whether the reduced deforestation is the outcome of successful implementation of policies and measures, or is an outlier due to inter-annual variability in the deforestation rate. in any event, overselling would have to be minimized, perhaps through a mechanism similar to the one already established under the kp for annex-i countries (unfccc 2002a). particular attention will have to be paid to the setting of the level against which future emissions are assessed. if targets are too weak, e.g. by grandfathering high emissions levels from the past, then lots of credits could be generated without necessarily having reduced deforestation against a business-as-usual case. if, on the other hand, targets are very ambitious, then it might happen that they cannot be reached by the country, which leads to the next question: should non-achievement of targets lead to penalties? this could deter many countries from participating in the system. without penalties, there is still the risk that a country might move so far above the target that it may become unrealistic to still reach the target (\"run-away non compliance\") so that there is no incentive to even start reducing emissions. as a solution to these issues, it is proposed here to defi ne a band within which a country's emissions are most likely to be in the target period. the lower bound would be the threshold below which the country could claim a full credit for each incremental ton reduced. the upper bound would be set so high that the possibility of emissions exceeding that amount is minimal. in order to minimize the problem of scale

however, are not only potential victims of global climate change. attentiveness to environmental variability, shifts and trends is an integral part of their ways of life. community-based and local knowledge may offer valuable insights into environmental change due to climate change, and complement broader-scale scientific research with local precision and nuance. indigenous societies have elaborated coping strategies to deal with unstable environments, and in some cases, are already actively adapting to early climate change impacts. while the transformations due to climate change are expected to be unprecedented, indigenous knowledge and coping strategies provide a crucial foundation for community-based adaptation measures. indigenous knowledge was acknowledged in the fourth

concerning the limits of responsibility attribution. suppose that climate change could be traced entirely to natural climatic variations. in such cases, 'contribution to problem' reasoning could not explain why the victims of climate change should not be abandoned to their fate even if measures could be undertaken by wealthy countries to limit their suffering. the focus on historical responsibility, that is, clears the way to a 'polluted pays' approach when there are no identifiable polluters. while this conclusion could be finessed by appealing to substantive principles of justice, this would mean abandoning the theoretical parsimony provided by focusing on historical responsibility.3suppose, next, following an example devised by simon caney (caney 2005, p. 763), a developing country was shown to have been a major historical greenhouse emitter of a similar level to the uk. the 'contribution to problem' approach implies that this country should bear a heavy burden, on a par with the uk, to finance climate mitigation and adaptation policies despite its poverty.4"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What could pose a problem to health?", "id": 14822, "answers":

climate variability and change in not only developing but also developed countries, and that high levels of adaptive capacity may not be realized in practice in the face of stress. for example, events such as hurricane katrinaand the 2003 european heat wave have shown that the capacity to adapt to climate-related extreme events is lower than expected and, as a result, their consequences and associated vulnerabilities are higher than previously thought. it is also now possible to better identify specific systems, sectors, and regions across the globe that are particularly vulnerable. there are sharp differences across the globe, in large measure because those in the weakest economic position are often the most vulnerable to climate change and are frequently the most susceptible to climate-related damages. this is especially true when they face multiple stresses; it is also now recognized that climate change can, itself, be the source of multiple stresses. new studies confirm that africa is one of the most vulnerable continents because of the range of projected impacts, multiple stresses, and low adaptive capacity (18). for these reasons, and because ipcc ar4 (12) show

the main objectives of this study were to detect human-induced vegetation changes and evaluate the impacts of land use policies in the xilingol grassland region of inner mongolia, using the ndvi-based residual trend (restrend) method. our results show that human activity (livestock grazing) was the primary driver for the observed vegetation changes during the period of 1981-2006. specifically, vegetation became increasingly degraded from the early 1980s when the land use policy--the household production responsibility system--led to soaring stocking rates for about two decades. since 2000, new institutional arrangements for grassland restoration and conservation helped curb and even reverse the increasing trend in stocking rates, resulting in large-scale vegetation improvements in the region. these results suggest that most of the degraded grasslands in the xilingol region can recover through ecologically sound land use policies or institutional arrangements that keep stocking rates under control. our study has also demonstrated that the restrend method is a useful tool to help identify human-induced vegetation changes in arid and semiarid landscapes where plant cover and production are highly coupled with precipitation. to effectively use the method, however, one needs to carefully deal with the problems of heterogeneity and scale in space and time, both of which may

'soft reciprocity', whereby leading states initiate ambitious climate policies that encourage others to reciprocate by raising their own level of ambition. in a context where national mitigation pledges are not legally binding and cannot be enforced, the main currencies of international climate politics will thus be political leadership, financial assistance and moral suasion. whether the paris agreement can produce the desired effect of boosting the global mitigation effort remains to be seen. this critically depends on whether its core mechanism of five-yearly reviews can be made to work. for this to happen, a robust transparency framework for the reporting and verification of emissions reduction pledges and their national implementation will be needed. cop-21 established the principles for this framework, but future negotiations will need to create specific transparency rules and mechanisms. it also remains to be seen whether peer pressure between states and 'naming and shaming' strategies by ngos can nudge recalcitrant states into greater ambition. the paris negotiations managed to produce a high level of political mobilization and support on the part of civil society and business, which in itself is a major achievement. but it would take only a small number of large emitters to derail global efforts to stay within the temperature target of below 2degc. given that the world is currently on course for a global warming trend of 3degc or more, the margin of error for the new climate regime is worryingly small. in the context of the new logic of domestically determined climate policy, much will depend on whether climate leaders are willing and able to push for more ambitious policies, invest in green technologies and chart the way into a low-carbon economic future. such leadership could be provided by states that seek to move faster and further with decarbonization plans than their peers. small groups of states, acting in 'coalitions of the willing' or 'climate clubs', may emerge to create regional carbon trading schemes or promote technology transfer schemes.51 leadership could also be provided by non-state actors, most notably business organizations and ngos that come together to establish transnational climate actions and voluntarily cooperate to pursue low-carbon strategies. the paris agreement will benefit from such forms of climate leadership, and it can play an important role in providing a supportive environment in which innovative initiatives can be encouraged and nurtured. as should be clear from the above discussion, much of the paris agreement's potential contribution remains to be developed in future cop negotiations. paris was a breakthrough event, but it did not 'fix' the climate problem. nor could it have hoped to do so. international climate diplomacy has finally caught up with the reality of the global warming problem, which requires a long-term political effort to steer global investment in the direction of a lowcarbon economic future. paris provides a more realistic approach to achieving this vision, but it is not the end of this journey; in many ways it is only the beginning."},

policy is no exception. however, 'constituencies for change' are slowly emerging - groups that see a business opportunity (as well as an environmental necessity) in the move to a low-carbon economy. this note has tried to analyse whether they have a case. the picture that emerges is complex. in the short term, low-carbon technologies are more labour-intensive than conventional solutions. that differential will diminish as technologies become more efficient but, everything else being equal, the short-term employment effect of climate policy should be positive. economy-wide effects will reinforce this trend over the medium term, even if the cost burden associated with carbon abatement will dampen aggregate demand. early movers may develop a comparative advantage that could create export-related jobs, while unilateral action could result in a loss of competitiveness and the migration of jobs elsewhere. however, neither effect may last. over time, technology transfer will erode the comparative advantage of early movers, and 'job leakage' will diminish as more and more countries adopt climate policies. the biggest effects will be felt over the long term, when technical change and innovation could trigger a fundamental overhaul of the economic system. earlier episodes of innovation-led structural change teach us that it can be a powerful engine for job creation, productivity improvements and growth. skill-biased technical change has been behind much of the wealth created in western economies over the last few decades. there is also evidence that adept policy can trigger such innovation. if this evidence is right, climate change has the potential to create many more jobs than it destroys in the long run."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What's the one important

whether timescales of thousands to tens of thousands of years should matter to our evaluation of climate risks. a conventional approach is to devalue the costs of future impacts using some exponential discount rate81. indeed, it is reasonable to discount costs in the future -- paying now to avoid future costs results in an opportunity cost (that is, the loss of money could be used for immediate benefit). even with a low discount rate, future climate impacts on thousand-year time scales would be valued as zero, irrespective of the levels of certainty and magnitude. on the other hand, some behavioural studies have argued for a hyperbolic form of discounting, which asymptotes to a low and constant value over time, as most people do place some small value on the distant future82. but this

first perspective, twitter is interesting as an organizing mechanism within the specific protest ecology. as well as transmitting information, networked protest spaces constitute negotiated spheres of individual and collective agency. as digital and social media become increasingly prominent, they too become networking agents (or actants; latour, 2005) within the protest space. the presence or absence of affordances and discourses constrain and enable action in these often densely linked and navigable spaces, at the same time as they help structure relations among different actors, issues, and events (foot schneider, 2006). such networks of people and technologies can operate differently in terms of coherence, sustainability, and effectiveness of associated actions, and this invites attention to how collective action spaces develop and play out under different circumstances (cf. langlois, mckelvey, elmer, werbin, 2009). digitally networked protest spaces often involve dense webs of technologies deployed by different actors, so twitter is one of potentially many digital mechanisms that coconstitute and coconfigure the protest space. from the second perspective, twitter streams may reveal interesting features of the protest ecology's wider composition, and in particular something of the organizational scheme in which they are embedded. this may, among other things, indicate something of the larger network of relations involved in a particular event, even if it does not tell the whole story about them (cf. huberman, romero, wu, 2009). one alternative is to analyze the users contributing to a stream (where these are identifiable; boyd ellison, 2007); another is to turn the stream inside out to look at who and what is linked to rather than who is posting. the organizations and social media linked in tweets reveal a sample of the organizations, information sources, and social networking sites pertinent to a particular protest ecology. for example, link data from the climate change protests that we discuss later reveal how different organizations (from advocacy organizations to government agencies) and information sources (e.g., the bbc, the united nations news center, the brookings institution, bloggers) become engaged with activist networks at various stages of protest events. the contexts of these links include participants assessing the mass media effect of real time actions, sharing think tank material, and recounting their own experiences at events. this twofold approach to twitter in digitally networked protests can only be indicative; it cannot roll out a definitive map of the protest space. what is more, twitter may play very different roles in different ecologies. with these conditions in mind, we nevertheless distinguish three

the discharge from burned and salvage-logged catchments four years after the wildfire; this result was particularly evident during stormflow. turbidity/tss and don demonstrated some recovery after the

must be carefully interpreted because \"recovery\" is a matter of perspective. much of the published literature considers recovery from watershed hydrology and ecological perspectives in which \"rapid recovery\" may occur over time frames of years. in contrast, \"rapid recovery\" during water treatment requires returns to baseline values within hours, days, or weeks, depending on available water

up to 100 m m figure 2 ). particles with diameters less than 1 m m are fine aerosols and are divided into the aitken mode (diameter 0.1 m m) and the accumulation mode (diameter 0.1 m m and 1.0 m m), and particles greater than 1 m m comprise the coarse aerosols. coarse aerosols are usually primary aerosols, meaning they were directly emitted and are often entrained into the atmosphere by the wind [e.g., desert dust or sea-salt particles (18)]. in contrast, many anthropogenic aerosols occur in the fine mode. a substantial portion of fine aerosols are not emitted directly but are formed in the atmosphere (sometimes directly after high-temperature combustion). these secondary aerosols are discussed in more detail below. although there tends to be a higher number of aerosols in the small size fractions, they contribute less mass, integrated over all the particles, because of their small size figure 2 ). in terms of mass, coarse particles dominate figure 2 ). the aerosol composition is also variable table 1 ). some aerosols are solid crustal material, whereas others are in aqueous solution (e.g., sulfuric acid), and still others are a mixture of solids and liquids. characteristics of color, hygroscopicity, and chemical composition strongly determine the impacts of aerosols on climate and biogeochemistry, as described"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has our understanding of the

years, are very common in engineering hydrological applications, as these are the lifetime periods of major engineering works. traditionally, in such cases, deterministic models and approaches, which

based on deterministic hydrological approaches has ever been made. on the other hand, in recent decades, numerous hydrological studies have attempted to cast projections of the impacts of hypothesized anthropogenic climate change on freshwater resources and their management, adaptation and vulnerabilities (kundzewicz et al ., 2008). all these studies are essentially based on the explicit or tacit

that studies which measure climate merely through the perceptions of managers generate results that differ from those examining a wider sample of employees. in that case, misleading interpretations might be made, and combining the two kinds of investigation in an overall review would yield inappropriate conclusions. the literature appears to have ignored this possibility. climate has typically been viewed as characteristic of an entire organization or sub-organization, apparently requiring measurement through the perceptions of a broad range of employees. for instance, wilderom et al (2000, p. 207) argued that \"it seems crucial that researchers investigate organizational members who are representative of all the ... levels of the organization\". with that in mind, early questionnaires (e.g. payne and pheysey, 1971) were explicitly designed for completion by employees of all kinds. however, more recent investigators have often derived climate scores from managers alone. for instance, gordon and ditomaso (1992) studied company performance as a function of perceptions by the top four or five levels of management. they recognized that \"management ... is clearly not a representative sample of the employees in the companies\" (p. 788). however, it was argued that, because of managers' greater influence over work processes, \"culture measured at this level will be most predictive of future behaviour and performance of the firm\" (p. 789). top managers only were studied by peters and waterman (1982), and a similar restriction was applied by gordon (1985), kotter and heskett (1992), sheridan (1992), denison (2001), denison and mishra (1995) and weber (1996), in each case excluding climate perceptions by non-managerial employees. there is evidence that managers' perceptions of their organization's climate tend to be there is evidence that managers' perceptions of their organization's climate tend to be more positive than perceptions by non-managers (payne and mansfield, 1973). however, we have located no empirical comparisons between the predictive strength of climate measures obtained from these two groups. despite the apparent importance of assessing experience widely across the work-force, there are two arguments for the possibly greater predictive value of managerial perceptions. first, it might be the case that managers' roles within a company provide them with more wide-ranging evidence on which to base their assessments of climate. whereas most non-managers necessarily have a perspective restricted to their own area of work, senior staff are often able to make more wide-ranging judgments. managers' perceptions of the company's climate may thus be based on more comprehensive"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the first

future climate projection. this methodology for pattern detection proves to be successful for the tropical atlantic climate change (tokinaga and xie 2011b). a major finding of the present study is that the zonal contrast of equatorial subsurface temperature in the tropical indopacific has significantly weakened in response to surface wind changes associated with a weakened walker circulation. regarding the cause of atmospheric circulation change, we also examine sst warming patterns and uncertainties by comparison of the sst and nighttime marine air temperature reconstructions. the rest of

project sandfly establishment in formerly non-endemic areas. this will additionally increase the risk of emerging sandfly-borne diseases in central europe such as leishmaniasis. nevertheless, it is

in temperature projections into three parts: initial condition uncertainty (i.e., variations in model predictions due to small changes in how they are initialized), emissions scenario uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about the path of future ghg emissions), and model uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about which climate model captures the dynamics of the climate system). figure 2 shows how these factors contribute to uncertainty about global mean temperature over time. for short-term predictions, that is, less than about twenty years into the future, initial condition and model uncertainty are dominant. the fact that initial condition uncertainty plays an important role for shorter term predictions should come as no surprise. the climate system is chaotic, and the evolution of chaotic systems, by definition, shows great sensitivity to initial conditions. hawkins and sutton (2009) show that initial condition uncertainty is especially important for regional predictions, making substantial contributions to total uncertainty for predictions of sixty years or more. at the global level, for projections twenty to fifty years into the future, the dominant source of uncertainty is model uncertainty (i.e., the variation in predictions across the set of climate models). beyond about fifty years, emissions scenario uncertainty takes over. that is, the policies we ultimately choose

technologically dynamic industries. commercializing technologies: niche market or mainstream market another challenge with regard to the corporate climate change innovation process is the issue of commercialization - how to develop new markets. as discussed above, commercialization involves the integration of new technology in the design and manufacturing process, responsiveness to market needs, speed of time-to-market, fl exibility and getting ahead of regulatory activity on climate change (rothwell, 1994). hence, whether a company succeeds in commercializing the innovation depends not only on its technical attributes, but also on creating consumer acceptance of the technology, establishing a low-carbon brand reputation and anticipating government regulation (schot and geels, 2007). since the market for climate-induced innovations is relatively novel, companies run the risk of making irreversible green mistakes and, as a consequence, will prefer an approach by which they maintain fl exibility in their resource commitments (rugman and verbeke, 1998). companies would like to have the option to pull out of the market without putting too many resources at risk if the innovation turns out not to deliver the expected rate of return. uncertainty about the outcomes of current climate policy negotiations aggravates this risk. in the long run, the ideal scenario would be an energy and transportation infrastructure that does not rely at all on fossil fuels. to reach this end-point, companies can follow two trajectories in developing new markets for low-carbon products, while safeguarding their fl exibility: a market niche or a mainstream market approach. the fi rst option is that companies aim for a trajectory of commercializing carbon-free technologies, where the low-carbon aspect forms the unique selling point. as heavy dependence on fossil fuels is the rule rather than the exception, this means a radical departure from existing markets and systems. one way of achieving this is to let a new technology fi rst develop in a market niche and then gradually progress through several other niches. such a strategy of 'market niche development' leads to the creation of institutions (e.g. safety rules), adjustment of consumer preferences and improvement of the fi t between the new technology and the market (kemp et al. 1998; raven, 2007). the main advantage of fi rst targeting niche markets is that it enables a company to experiment with several new technologies in parallel and thus helps in coping with uncertainty as several options are kept open. however, a market niche approach also has several drawbacks. it has proven diffi cult for companies to move their innovation beyond the market niche into mainstream markets. moreover, developing a sequence of market niches requires many resources, and if an insuffi cient rate of return is reached further investments will come to a halt (raven, 2007). to illustrate, the fact that the fuel cell vehicle was long predestined as the ultimate solution was partly because it followed the route of market niche development. since the 1960s, fuel cells have been used in several market niches, such as space travel and the us army and navy. however, fuel cell technology has still not managed to leave niche markets (raven, 2007). the second option is a trajectory of commercializing low-carbon technologies via incremental changes of existing products, where the low-carbon aspect just forms an extra element to other main selling points. this has been called 'hybridization' because innovation is commercialized as an add-on element to existing products, thus appealing to mainstream markets more swiftly (raven, 2007). this trajectory is a refl ection of the phenomenon that companies, when confronted with technological change, generally do not fully discard their existing key capabilities, but build on them instead (unruh, 2000). for example, recent evidence shows that us utilities with high levels of coal-based power generation were less likely to invest in renewable generation, as this would be a departure from capabilities in running large, centralized coal-fi red power plants (delmas et al. 2007). there is thus a certain level of inertia in the way in which companies adjust their capabilities in response to technological change (leonard-barton, 1992). as a consequence, a climate-induced market shift takes place through transition technologies (hekkert and van den hoed, 2004), which often means that companies commercialize technologies which may be less carbon intensive, but not carbon free. one of the issues then is whether low-carbon products that seem to be of a transitory nature at fi rst will not become dominant themselves, thus standing in the way of further market entry of more radical end-point solutions. for example, the recent success of hybrid cars such as the toyota prius might have serious consequences for the marketability of the fuel cell vehicle. the fuel cell's main advantage compared to the internal combustion engine - that it performs much better in terms of emissions -"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is thermal comfort closely

persons aged 45 to 64 were smaller (not presented) and this age group contributed relatively few excess deaths in the historical period (not shown). analyses of age groups younger than 45 were inconclusive, as there were insufficient numbers of deaths to produce stable relative risk values (not presented). we did not attempt to extend the mortality analysis beyond the duration of the heat event itself. this approach may have missed some latent deaths if they occurred after the heat event ended. however, by limiting the analysis just to the heat event, the calculated risk estimates should be conservative because they would tend to understate the deaths attributable to the event. in the spokane, tri-cities and yakima study areas, separately or combined, only a few, isolated relative risks were statistically significant. some patterns in relative risk, however, suggest real differences in mortality rates during heat events, but with samples perhaps too small to support statistical significance. projected annual numbers of excess deaths in the greater seattle area were substantial under some conditions; even under moderate summer (maysept.) warming, the area can expect around 100 excess non-traumatic deaths in 2025 and more than 150 excess in 2045. the projections for the eastern study areas combined were much smaller. even when projected population is taken into account, excess deaths per 100,000 were much lower in spokane, tri-cities and yakima than in the greater seattle area. this could be explained in a number of ways. the urban heat island effect may be stronger in the more densely settled seattle area. to the extent that"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which approach could be used to identify the cluster structure in atmospheric pressure data?",

data. however, in this work, we will use our snn clustering approach described in [2, 3, 4]. this technique first finds the nearest neighbors of each data point and then redefines the similarity between pairs of points in terms of how many nearest neighbors the two points share. using this definition of similarity, our algorithm identifies core points and then builds clusters around the core points. the use of a shared nearest neighbor definition of similarity alleviates problems with varying densities and high dimensionality, and the use of core points handles problems with shape and size. furthermore, the number of clusters is automatically determined by the location and distribution of core points. another novel aspect of the snn clustering algorithm is that the resulting clusters do not contain all the points, but rather, contain only points that come from regions of relatively uniform density. these features allow the algorithm to find clusters that other approaches overlook, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent relatively uniform regions 'surrounded' by non-uniform or higher density areas. with respect to earth science data, snn clustering produces high quality clusters, which are almost always geographically contiguous, and automatically selects the number of clusters. because of space considerations, we omit a detailed description of the snn algorithm and refer the reader to [2, 4]. note that contains experimental results indicating that snn clustering works better than dbscan or k-means when the goal is to find clusters of

cases, however, a shift toward environmental conditions outside the normal range of variability is stressful, causing suboptimal physiological performance and thus creating the \"losers\" of environmental change. for such individuals, more stressful conditions may lead to higher mortality, reduced growth, smaller size, and reduced reproduction. generally, metabolic rates of ectothermic organisms rise exponentially with temperature, leading to higher rates for most physiological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration, within the range of temperatures that an organism tolerates. this relationship is formalized in the concept of q10, which is the rate increase resulting from a 10*c rise in temperature. for example, eppley (1972) reported an average q10 of 1.9 for growth rates among ~ 130 species and clones of phytoplankton, yielding a 37% increase in growth rate for a 2*c warming. on this basis, it might be expected that primary production, as well as the growth rates of ectothermic animals and pathogens, will increase in a warmer ocean. however, nutritional status, thermal tolerance, oxygen availability, environmental chemistry, food availability, or other factors may limit growth and production, or other biological processes, regardless of metabolic rate. in heterotrophic organisms, warmer temperatures raise basal metabolic rates but can also raise respiratory demand, potentially reducing their aerobic scope for activity (e.g., feeding, predator avoidance, digestion) and leaving less energy for growth and reproduction (p\"ortner knust

(80) impacts of a pathogen when its epidemiology shifts with a shifting climate. of course, at this scale, the number of interactions and even types of interactions rapidly increases, and changes in land use patterns will also be important factors (39). but it is relevant to consider eviner likens' factors for predicting ecosystem effects and how pathogen characterization might shift with climate change: a pathogen effect on host survival, physiology, behavior, and/or reproduction; b life stages of a host vulnerable to a pathogen; c proportion of individuals/biomass infected at a site; d spatial extent and distribution of infection; e rate of pathogen effects on hosts in relation to rate of response/recovery by hosts or individuals replacing hosts; f functional similarity of infected individuals versus replacements; and g frequency and duration of pathogen impact. many of these factors have been addressed in other sections of this review, but the sixth is of particular interest for scaling up predictions to the ecosystem level. it is possible that, even in the extreme event that a plant species should go extinct due to greater pathogen effects resulting from climate change, plant species that replace it could maintain ecosystem function. on the other hand, if climate change produces major shifts in which agricultural species are present in a region, this may result in important changes in nutrient loss from agriculture to surrounding ecosystems. ultimately, the study of such large-scale processes will be facilitated by remote sensing of plant populations. although remote sensing technologies have advanced rapidly, there are still challenges to identifying particular plant species and to distinguishing between different types of plant stress in the field (146).

is the oil giant shell. although the product has changed from fossil fuels to renewables, the corporation is still the same. the power dynamic remains; often the renewable investments of large fossil fuel corporations are another tactic in a cleverly planned \"greenwash\" campaign to improve their public image. additionally the failure to challenge corporate monopolies in the renewable energy sector could stifle diversity and innovation as was shown when comparing developments in the netherlands and germany. in the netherlands, subsidies for the solar industry in the 1990s were concentrated on shell and eco-consultants ecofys. this limited the number of solar panel firms to just a few main players and shell gained a virtual monopoly in solar panel installation. in contrast, german subsidies were distributed more fairly across different sized firms. by 2002 there were over 300 companies involved in supplying solar panels.30even a future where wind and solar are the main source of energy still fails to challenge underlying patterns of consumption and does not guarantee that transnational corporations will suddenly behave in an environmentally or socially just way. many grassroots initiatives have nevertheless arisen to tackle these problems and it is here that we can see the outlines of an holistic approach to the problem posed by climate change. thousands of small-scale projects successfully balancing social and economic injustice with environmental sustainability have already sprung up around the world. the centre for alternative technology in wales, for example, is in the process of building a wind turbine, a project that was initiated and is managed by the local community. the energy will be used locally, and any surplus sold and the dividends are to be shared among the community group.31another initiative is in the process of being launched in northern spain by a project called escanda who are engaged in planning and forming a renewable energy

mitigation: reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to increase carbon biosequestration through reforestation and improved agricultural practices. the recognition by governments and electorates that climate change has enormous health implications should assist the advocacy and political change needed to tackle both mitigation and adaptation. management of the health eff ects of

slow down global warming and eventually stabilise temperatures. second, action should be taken on the events linking climate change to disease. third, appropriate public health systems should be put into place to deal with adverse outcomes. while we must resolve the key issue of reliance on fossil fuels, we should acknowledge their contribution to huge improvements in global health and

measures that, by design, are the same for every student within a given classroom. a hierarchical estimation accounts for the grouped nature of the data by modeling the intercept of the individual-level equation (level 1) as a function of the school-level variables (level 2). in these hierarchical models, the level 1 intercept has been freed to vary randomly rather than remaining fixed. in order to facilitate comparisons of effect sizes across the variables, all of the continuous and ordinal independent variables have been coded to have a mean and standard deviation of 1.0. their coefficients thus reflect the impact of a one standard-deviation change in that independent variable. the variables have all been centered on their grand means. results table 2 reports the

receptors can be both biophysical entities (e.g. the crops of a famer) and social systems (e.g. the farmer household), depending on the objective of analysis. it is further not required that the receptor of an adaptation is an exposure unit at the same time. this is a crucial point that will become clear in what follows. we illustrate this with the early warning system example introduced above. the operator is a public body that runs the system. it receives weather forecasts and transmits them to the public in an accessible way. the purpose of that adaptation is to reduce harm to individual transport users (that can decide to use other modes of transportation or avoid travelling in the case of a warning). the intention is to change behavior of transport users, making them the receptors. the public body is not the exposure unit (it is not affected by heavy rain); the receptors of the early warning system are the exposure units. the emphasis on the purpose of an action requires further comment. there are, of course, many social phenomena that are not purposeful. in this case, we do not call them actions, but mere processes. processes are sequences of events in time that may occur in a biophysical, technical or social entity or system. they can be framed as being linked through causality, that is, in a mechanistic way. actions are a special class of social processes that additionally have a teleological component (cf. weber 1922, and the discussion in the next section). to implement the adaptation, the operator needs resources, here called means these could be access to financial or other material resources, legal power, social networks, knowledge, or availability of information. action is further shaped by constraints and resources that cannot be controlled by the operator. these are called the conditions (cf. parsons 1937, see next section). in the example, the primary means employed by the operator of the early warning system is the information that is provided to the receptors. further means involved are the public funding and the education of the people running the system, but these are not channeled directly to the transport users. as an example of a condition, we can cite the attitudes of the receptors toward the early warning system: do they actually listen to the forecasts? do they trust the forecasts? does the information they are given lead to behavioral change? another is the institutional and legal context: is there stable funding for the early warning system? are operators liable if forecasts are incorrect? it is helpful to further differentiate three notions of means: available means, employed means and necessary means available means are those that are disposable by the operator, while the employed means is that part that is actually used for a specific adaptation. that does not imply that the adaptation is effective, since success requires the use of the necessary means - which might be available or not. it is important to note that these three types of means are not necessarily identical. 7"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is control scenario?", "id": 8723, "answers": [{"text":

assess the importance of the internal variability in a nested rcm. to this aim, ensembles of 20 simulations were performed over five different domain sizes. each of the 20 simulations was driven by the same set of timedependent lbcs taken from ncep-ncar reanalyses using prescribed ssts. the different members of the ensembles were initialized at 1-day intervals; the simulations were performed with the canadian rcm (crcm) for one summer season over the east coast of north america. internal variability is defined as the spread between the members during the integration period. the results show that internal variability depends strongly on synoptic events, as seen by the pulsating behavior of its time evolution. internal variability displays a preferential region within the domain, depending on the variable. for example, precipitation, which is a difficult variable to simulate accurately (kunkel et al. 2002), shows the largest variability in the southeast united states, where large convective precipitation occurs, while the 850-hpa geopotential height variability is largest in the northeast part of the domain corresponding to the downstream region. evaluation of the time evolution of the synoptic patterns suggests that the maxima of variability in precipitation and 850-hpa geopotential height may be linked: the former, mostly located in the southeast united states, acts as a triggering mechanism for the latter, which continues to develop along the storm track and reaches its maximum toward the northeast of the domain. this study confirms earlier results that internal variability increases with domain size. the study also shows that changes to the domain size may alter considerably the geographical distribution of the internal variability. the repercussions of internal variability are also felt on seasonal-mean quantities. this suggests that oneseason statistics of simulated fields, especially precipitation, may be poorly estimated from a single simulation. our results indicate that a minimum number of 10 members are required for a robust estimation of a seasonal-mean value for midlatitude summer in certain areas where larger internal variability develops within the large domains. the study suggests that a reduction of the domain size generally results in a significant reduction of the differences between the members' statistics. there remain, however, regions with substantial internal variability magnitude, even at the seasonal scale. a closer look at the evolution of the members in the ensembles reveals the occasional occurrence of bimodal solutions for the largest domains, during episodes of large internal variability. model bimodal solutions could be the consequence of dynamical conditions that favor certain states (lorenz 1963; plu and arbogast 2005), or could simply be the effect of poor sampling of the distribution with only 20 members. in any case, it is"}, {"qas": [{"question": "How are the results

climate change relates to levels of public concern, which is often used as an indicator of risk perception. results indicated that generally lower psychological distance was associated with higher concern about climate change. our data imply that, in order to promote concern about climate change, risk communications should focus on making climate change psychologically closer and make potential climate change impacts relevant to individuals' social group, locality, and lifetime. here, considerations of distant impacts and impacts on developing countries were not so important. we must caution that all relationships observed here are examined within crosssectional data and therefore causality cannot be identified, only assumed. in relation to promoting action on climate change, relevant psychological distance considerations were slightly different. our data indicate that, as with relationships with concern, making climate change relevant to the audience's locality and social groups is important in promoting action, as is reducing uncertainty over whether climate change is happening and reducing the perceived temporal distance of effects. however, here the perceived impacts on developing countries were much more important. so here, actually, the greater the disproportionate impacts on distant developing countries that were perceived in relation to climate change (i.e., the greater the psychological distance), the more people were prepared to undertake sustainable behavior. this indicates that whilst personal, local, closer considerations of climate change are important in promoting concern about climate change, when it comes to promoting action, it may also be important to highlight the wider, global impacts of climate change. this is congruent with earlier studies that find that respondents actually tend to perceive climate change impacts to be more serious at distant locations(35)as well as with theoretical predictions drawn from clt. clt points to the importance of psychological distance in promoting action.(4)previous evidence has demonstrated that focusing on distance helps people to make decisions that are more in line with their core beliefs. focusing on the implications of climate change for distant developing countries may therefore help people gain perspective on their actions, which may help to explain why these perceptions relate to preparedness to act but not to concern about climate change. of course, we also found that elements of psychological closeness are important in promoting action, which does not support previous theorizing within clt. in another way, it could be considered that psychological closeness could be related to stronger intentions to act, if thinking specifically about climate change impacts in terms of a local context might reduce ambiguities about how to act on climate change.(26)psychological closeness and a focus on specific detailed aspects of the situation are highlighted as important for increasing the likelihood of action within goal setting theory. goal setting theory would suggest that considering psychologically close impacts of climate change should help to direct attention and effort towards relevant actions, can activate task relevant knowledge, and may energize the individual and increase persistence on actions attempted. it appears therefore that our results indicating that both psychological closeness and psychological distance are important in encouraging people to act on climate change supports elements of both clt and goal setting theory. this also supports the findings of rabinovitch et al .,(34)which indicate that a combination of both an mindset and specific goals may have most utility in promoting climate, change, related behavior. indeed, as discussed earlier, predictions of clt and goal setting theory are not necessarily incompatible given the slightly differing focus of each (clt focusing on translating core values into behavior and goal setting theory focusing on translating intentions into action). we do want to highlight that we examined only behavioral intentions here, not actual behavior, which might benefit from a psychological distance or closeness that we cannot examine here. notably, we find that concern has the strongest relationship with preparedness to act, greatly reducing the influence of psychological distance dimensions on preparedness to act (and acting as a significant partial mediator of this relationship). however, certain key psychological distance variables retained significant relationships with preparedness to act over and above concern about climate change, indicating that communications regarding psychological distance may be useful for a range of sectors of society, including those who already express high concern on climate change. 5. conclusions current discussions and debate on climate change frequently refer to the psychological distance of climate change. however, there has been little 14 spence, poortinga, and pidgeon in-depth empirical analysis of the operation of this perceived distance and only limited transfer of these ideas to risk communication strategies. our results indicate that the u.k. public really perceives climate change as global, being both distant and local in nature. we observe differences in levels of uncertainty about different aspects of climate change and note that there is a possibility of transfer between different aspects of uncertainty, highlighting the problematic nature of media representations of apparent public uncertainty over climate change. overall, our findings point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance and to engage the general public with climate change. however, we note that certain aspects of psychological distance, particularly considerations of the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change, may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior. acknowledgments this research was supported by a research grant from the economic and social research council (res-062-23-1134) as well as a climate change leader fellowship

filter, removing the nutrients and providing conditions for the retention and transformation of the organic matter contained in the sewage. besides that, it protects the soil against erosion and

a network for importing foreign queens has therefore been established in france for a very long time. however, these hybrids and other races are often less well-adapted and more susceptible to disease than local races. in france, there are therefore those who defend the local dark race, as these ecotypes are well adapted to their biotope, whilst others choose to import and use hybrid bees to ensure better harvests. the result of these opposing trends is wide genetic diversity in france, owing to continuing hybrid imports and to the genetic pollution of local honey bees. in north america, it is prohibited to import queen bees for health reasons. in spite of the huge sums spent on preventing such imports, american honey bees have more diseases than european ones. in the usa, a few large-scale queen bee breeders are responsible for renewing the stock, with each breeder selling hundreds of thousands of queens. they raise their queens from just a few of their best strains, which reduces the genetic diversity of the honey bee population and so weakens the bees' defences against various pathogens. in a global warming perspective, france's situation is assuredly a more comfortable one, as french honey bees are endowed with greater genetic diversity and therefore have greater adaptive potential. the same is not necessarily true of other european countries that ban imports and select their stock rigorously. this is an idea to be considered in the context of the spontaneous emergence of lines of varroa -resistant honey bees, as has occurred in france with the emergence of honey bee

produced in this way may be inconsistent with each other. such issues have led to the development of the socalled perturbed physics approach30-34. uncertain parameters in a single climate model may be perturbed to produce alternative simulations of past and future climate and climate change (as in the case of the simplified climate model approaches described above). in the perturbed physics approach, the input parameters are varied and the model is run using past and future radiative forcing. as in the general algorithm (fig. 1) we can imagine a point in the parameter space that maps to a point in the past-climate space that is consistent with the observations as measured by some metric, that is, is within the observational error bound. a simulation from a second point of parameter space may be less consistent with the observations. when we look at the future projections made using the model run from the first point, we may assume that these are more likely than the projections made from the second point. by running many ensemble members with the model covering the parameter space, it is possible to build up a weighted-distribution of future projections where the weights relate to the metric35. a key step in such analyses is to decide what observations to use: the choice is often determined by the design of the perturbed physics ensemble. in much of the work that has been conducted, a version of the atmosphere model coupled to a simple slab ocean has been used, restricting the observations to mainly time-averaged climatological fields36,37. in practice, running enough simulations to adequately sample a complex model parameter space and, moreover, to test the sensitivity of the projections to different assumptions about the distributions of those parameters, is computationally challenging. the burden can be eased using emulators, which are statistical models of ensembles that map input parameters to outputs, so enabling larger pseudo-ensemble calculations to be performed (albeit with loss of numerical accuracy)38. to combine the climate model outputs with the observations and emulators is a difficult statistical problem that is most easily handled in a bayesian framework35. a further refinement is to introduce a term to represent irreducible or structural errors in a climate model. if we imagine a point in parameter space at which the model produces its best simulation of both past and future climate, then, unless the model is perfect, there will still be a mismatch between model outputs and reality. specifying the structure of this mismatch remains one of the most challenging problems in climate projection. one possibility is to take the discrepancy from the mme as a lower bound on this 'structural error'37. the strengths of the perturbed physics/bayesian approach are that, in principle, many different observational constraints can be brought to bear on the projections, and projections of many complex climate variables (for example, involving regional averages and extremes) may be produced39 (fig. 5). projections of several quantities simultaneously (joint projections) are also possible where the complex climate model provides the physical link between changes in those different variables. the main weakness is that to use the latest, most comprehensive of climate models, the implementation is expensive in terms of computing resources and requires a very high level of technical expertise. this makes it hard to understand in simple physical terms how the observations constrain the projections."}, {"qas":

groups, and local communities. climate change is potentially the biggest global health threat in the 21st century. our response requires a new public health movement that is multidisciplinary and multisectoral, and that leads to coordinated thinking and action across governments, international agencies, ngos, and academic institutions. any adaptation interventions must sit alongside the need for primary mitigation: reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. indeed, recognition by governments and electorates that climate change has enormous health implications should assist the advocacy and political change to tackle mitigation and adaptation. whichever mitigation strategies are chosen by governments or agreed at the copenhagen conference, the move to a low-carbon economy will have global health benefi ts and these must also be emphasised. more research is needed on win-win solutions, which are equally important in developed and developing countries. we have proposed a framework for responding to the health eff ects through adaptation strategies, which in turn embeds mitigation strategies to improve human health worldwide. this framework raises several important issues for action: * climate change mitigation and adaptation are essential elements to overall development policy. they are not separate issues that can be divided from the agenda for poverty alleviation or for closing the gap on social inequalities and health. * the most urgent need is to empower poor countries, and local government and local communities everywhere, to understand climate implications and to take action. health professionals and university academics have an important catalytic role. multidisciplinary groups from higher education institutions can have a forceful role in engaging with community leaders, civil society organisations, and students in these debates. there is a need for new fi nancing for global links between developed and developing countries that create a two-way dialogue. developed countries can help to strengthen capacity for high-quality research and information collection in developing countries, and developing countries can strengthen the ability of developed countries to understand sustainability and low-carbon living. empowerment is as much about community mobilisation as high-level political action. the empowerment process is likely to be pluralistic and chaotic, but health and academic communities can do much to support and catalyse these processes. * an agenda for developing countries must be developed through global cooperation. representation on global task forces to assess the health eff ect of climate change is heavily skewed in favour of institutions in developed countries. in poor countries, health assessments and high-level climate science and health surveillance research are a priority. new research and advocacy groupings in africa and south asia are needed, and the academic community of developed countries must have a role in lobbying for resources and support. food and water insecurity are early eff ects of climate change and will be a high priority for poor communities. distilling academic fi ndings into simple language, policy briefs, and user-friendly media is essential. * climate change should be integrated into the entire discourse of our present and should be taken into consideration for all governance actions. an advocacy movement must ensure that the health eff ects of climate change are placed high on the agenda of every research and development funder, philanthropist, academic journal, scientifi c conference, professional meeting, and university or school curriculum. academics should lead advocacy within their own spheres of infl uence. * accountability mechanisms are crucial. we hope that this report will initiate or stimulate new funding and networks to monitor what is happening in government, civil society, academia, local government, and communities, especially in the most vulnerable populations. accountability indicators should be monitored by the academic community and civil society organisations. it should be possible to agree upon health and climate change goals and targets for the processes of engagement and empowerment. global and regional conferences and working groups to develop these outputs would be valuable in the same way that previous reports published in the lancet have stimulated action on child survival, nutrition, and maternal health through the countdown to 2015. a biennial review of progress towards agreed targets would help to accelerate progress through celebration of success and identifi cation of areas where progress is lagging. * awareness of health risks can have an important role in strengthening carbon mitigation

regardless of the cost. neither position is appropriate. on one hand, increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere exposes the world to the risk of an adverse change in the climate, even though the distribution of that risk is poorly understood. enough is known to justify reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly to preserve the option of avoiding an irreversible change in the climate. on the other hand, too little is known about the causes and consequences of climate change to justify a draconian cut in emissions. given the uncertainties, a prudent approach would be to abate emissions where possible at modest cost. minimizing the cost of abating a given amount of greenhouse emissions requires that all sources clean up amounts that cause their marginal costs of abatement to be equated. to achieve this, the standard economic policy prescription would be a market-based instrument, such as a tax on emissions or a tradable permit system for emission rights. in the absence of uncertainty, the efficient level of abatement could be achieved under either policy, although the distributional effects of tax and emissions trading policies would be very different. under uncertainty, however, the situation becomes more complicated. weitzman"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is not included in our bioenergy potential calculations?", "id": 7678, "answers":

at high and low elevations. in the lowlands, land cover has occurred primarily as conversion of forest to urban or partially urban land use, and here the land cover signal dominates temperature change. in the uplands, both land cover and temperature change have played important roles. temperature change is especially important at intermediate elevations (so-called transient snow zone), where the winter snow line is most sensitive to temperature change--notwithstanding the effects of forest harvest over the same part of the basin. model simulations show that current land cover results in higher fall, winter and early spring streamflow but lower summer flow; higher annual maximum flow and higher annual mean streamflow compared with pre-development conditions, which is largely consistent with a trend analysis of model residuals. land cover change effects in urban and partially urban basins have resulted in changes in annual flow, annual maximum flows, fall and summer flows. for the upland portion of the basin, shifts in the seasonal distribution of streamflows (higher spring flow and lower summer flow) are clearly related to rising temperatures, but annual streamflow has

the world may need not only high adaptive capacity but also significant emissions mitigation to have been implemented in order to avoid high levels of vulnerability. overall, these results challenge assumptions about which countries have \"enough\" adaptive capacity (because they are wealthy or impacts will be mild or both). the results, while highly suggestive, are surely dependent upon our framing of a specific vulnerability index which presumes a certain, perhaps limited degree of substitutability between experiencing high exposure and generating reduced sensitivity through adaptation. they are also derived from an old-school \"what if?\" approach to scenarios. what if atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases were limited to 550 ppm? what if adaptive capacity were enhanced significantly around the world? we have not tied our thought experiments to any reason why either approach to the climate problem would be chosen; nor have we said anything about how difficult it might be to do either. indeed, we have said nothing about the relative costs of mitigation and programs that would enhance adaptive capacity; and we certainly do not want to give the impression that a 550 ppm concentration cap should be adopted. we have, though, demonstrated that these and other questions can be explored in a way that recognizes global diversity explicitly and that calibrates, however roughly, plausible exposure levels to accepted indicators of adaptive capacity in different places. indeed, we think that it is important to be able to offer suggestive evidence that developing countries are most vulnerable to modest climate change but that all countries could be overwhelmed by more severe exposure. we also think that it is important to be able to suggest that developed countries could benefit most from even near-term mitigation in those not so implausible futures where climate changes rapidly and/or abruptly. given more time and a cornucopia of analyses that do incorporate more of these details, we therefore offer hope that researchers and negotiators alike will become better informed about who is most vulnerable to climate change (both in terms of exposure and in their adaptive capacity), where they live, why they are vulnerable, and the relative efficacy of various degrees of mitigation in improving their lots in life. iaj, vol. 6, iss. 3

).''28 this apparent window of opportunity led the economist to suggest a perspective on energy policy arguably more in line with common interests, ''a more suitable target for green ire would be the gross inefficiency of the world's energy systems (2001).'' some clearly believe that that the global warming issue can carry all of energy policy on its back. the boston globe (2001) editorialized that: the energy shortage and global warming can be cured by the same medicine: reducing us reliance on fossil fuels. the energy efficiency standards required to meet the kyoto goals would also ease the united states out of its oil dependence. the arguments provided in this paper (and by others elsewhere) suggest that this ''two birds with one stone'' approach has been and will continue to be a dramatic failure with respect to both climate and energy policies. alternatively, an energy policy focused on the human and environmental costs of fossil fuels, where costs are defined beyond simple markets economics to include their typically ignored broader human and environmental impacts, an ample case can be made for increased efficiency, greater conservation, enhanced energy research and development, and technology diffusion. for many of the poorest nations of the world the future threats posed by climate pale in comparison to the immediate benefits to be achieved by greater use of energy. as naresh chandra, ambassador to the u.s. from india commented, at the moment we [in india] have a much higher and urgent priority, and that is eradication of poverty, removal of backwardness, and improving the level of living of our people. that is a much greater, urgent necessity than the long-term aim of controlling greenhouse gas emissions we have a huge power shortage in india newshour, 1997 ). thus, energy policy, as well as climate policy, has dimensions that go well beyond consideration of climate change to include issues such as pollution, efficiency, and independence. each of these issues forms an immediate, practical grounding on which to address the many policy problems that comprise the climate change issue. any progress on these problems would have the additional benefit of reducing greenhouse gases emissions, arguably at a pace much quicker than the current approach. 7. concluding thoughts there is no doubt that fccc and the kyoto protocol represent tremendous diplomatic accomplishments. negotiations have raised awareness of countries around the world to the importance of climate and focused them on shared objectives. but at the same time, this approach does not get at the core societal and environmental problems of climate change. one essential factor in motivating positive evolution of the fccc is to consider how it might be structured around a broader definition that allows for a clearer distinction of energy policy and climate policy. such an approach offers no panacea to dealing with the challenges of climate change, but at a minimum it offers a radial reframing of the issue that may open up discussion of paths not seen and options not previously considered. in terms of climate policy, such a reframing would mean a transition from a focus on ''dangerous anthropogenic interference'' to a focus on the impacts and opportunities related to climate, recognizing that the word ''climate'' by definition includes the notion of variability and change. with such a framing the fccc could form the basis for international climate and energy policies that actually serve to diminish environmental degradation and improve human lives.29"}, {"qas": [{"question": "how were Models calibrated?", "id": 18607, "answers": [{"text": "models were calibrated using a 70% random sample of the clouded apollo butterfly distribution

bartonella and several viruses. recent sandfly catches and autochthonous cases of leishmaniasis hint on spreading tendencies of the vectors towards central europe. however, studies addressing potential future distribution of sandflies in the light of a changing european climate are missing. methodology: here, we modelled bioclimatic envelopes using maxent for five species with proven or assumed vector competence for leishmania infantum which are either predominantly located in (south-) western phlebotomus ariasi p. mascittii and p. perniciosus or south-eastern europe p. neglectus and

habitats by integrating landscape features, projected changes in climatic suitability and wind speed. results and relevance: results indicate that the central european climate will become increasingly suitable especially for those vector species with a current south-western focus of distribution. in general, the highest suitability of central europe is projected for all species in the second half of the 21st century, except for p. perfiliewi nevertheless, we show that sandflies will hardly be able to occupy their climatically suitable habitats entirely, due to their limited natural dispersal ability. a northward spread of species with south-eastern focus of distribution may be constrained but not completely avoided by the alps. our results can be used to install specific monitoring

science a column of ocean water only 3m thick contains as much heat capacity as the full atmospheric column above (gill, 1982). hence, the oceans, which cover roughly 70% of the earth's surface, provide a large reservoir for heat and other constituents of the earth's climate system, such as the increasing amounts of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. through its buffering abilities and relatively slow time scales, the ocean represents the flywheel of the earth's climate system. that is, as goes the ocean, so goes the climate system. a scientific understanding of the ocean's time mean state, as well as its variability about this mean and its stability to various forms of perturbations, represents a key goal of physical oceanography and climate science. due to our inability to perform controlled experiments on large-scale systems studied in the geosciences, such as the earth's climate and its component subsystems, computer models represent a critical tool for rationalizing climate phenomena. indeed, computer models are becoming the primary tools used to study and predict physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the ocean fluid, reflecting the growing power of computers, improved knowledge and observations of the ocean, and enhancements in the realism of ocean model simulations. that ocean models are increasingly being used by all sorts of scientists, including those without direct experience developing models, is a sign that the models have enhanced their physical integrity over the past decades to a level deserving a general respect within the broader climate science community. correspondingly, as model usage increases, model developers have a growing responsibility to ensure that their codes are physically based, numerically sound, and well documented. given this mandate, one aim of this book is to establish a level of ocean model documentation that goes beyond the usual technical discussion that assumes the model user is familiar with the fundamentals and understands the physical meanings of the mathematical symbols. instead, we develop the equations from a (mostly) first principles perspective and take some care to nurture a physical understanding of the mathematics. 2 chapter 1"}, {"qas": [{"question": "How is a company's response to climate change produced?", "id": 14050, "answers": [{"text": "occurs in many dimensions,

climate change in particular, we look at three indicators of the nature of corporate response: reports by outside organizations that document corporate responses and achievements; commitments to action undertaken by firms regarding emissions; and membership of firms in associations or alliances which take collective political action. we try to explain the paradox between the energetic efforts of firms and the lack of meaningful results by considering the multiple dimensions of a firm's response. the position of firms is not merely for or against action on climate change, nor even along a

advance favors a \" wait-and-see \" strategy of continuing to emit at high levels while allowing innovation to lower future abatement costs (e.g., wigley et al., 1996; manne and richels, 1997 ). by

climate action plan (betsill/rabe 2008). despite a limited number of success stories, such as boulder's carbon tax, barcelona's 'solar thermal ordinance' and london's congestion charge, it appears, however, that municipalities are reluctant to apply an authoritative mode of governing through regulative measures and strategic planning for climate protection. instead, a lack of willingness to act locally in the face of political, business and public opposition can be observed - even if the capacity to intervene exists (bulkeley/kern 2006). it may be added that far-reaching approaches, such as the of a carbon-tax or congestion charge, are difficult to achieve because they may require not only a consensus in the city council but also a referendum. having discussed the different modes of governing in the area of mitigation, we will now turn to the question as to how cities have been dealing with the new challenges posed by the need to adapt to the already apparent effects of climate change. 2.3 adaptation whereas cities had initiated mitigation policies and created networks even before the ipcc first assessment report was released, adaptation policies at local level are still in their infancy. the forerunner cities in the area of mitigation accepted scientific uncertainty, focusing on 'no-regret' measures and linking their activities closely to local and regional sustainable development. however, a sound scientific basis is imperative when developing an adaptation strategy (lindseth 2005: 63). this is one of the reasons why cities tend to wait until they are actually affected by extreme weather events. cities receive input and guidance from science and governmental institutions at national level in relation to adaptation. in many countries such institutions have started to investigate potential impacts and produce recommendations which show how actors at various levels can adapt to climate change. this stands in sharp contrast to the situation in the area of mitigation whereby the cities' mitigation activities were not recognised by national governments and the scientific community for several years, as a result of which learning-by-doing was the only option available to them to advance their knowledge in this area. nevertheless, numerous local governments produced and adopted mitigation plans whereas, at present, adaptation plans are only at a preliminary stage and range from preparatory studies on how to prepare an adaptation plan, e.g. for cape town, and impact assessments, e.g. for london, to the early"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Define

central hypotheses are examined: hypothesis 1: climate types and vegetation types explain a significant fraction of variation in evaporative index after accounting for effects of dryness index. this is our most general hypothesis and offers the most comprehensive analysis spanning the full range of fluxnet sites. it asks if vegetation or climate types act as additional controls on evaporative index, either increasing it or decreasing it relative to the expected value based on dryness index. hypothesis 2: the evaporative index realized at a particular dryness is lower for sites with a larger seasonal hydrologic surplus (defined below, equation (2)), particularly at sites with a winter wet (mediterranean) climate, compared to summer wet sites of the same dryness ep/ p ). increased seasonal surplus can be expected to elevate drainage and runoff because of increased frequency of saturation overland flow and gravity drainage processes. the mediterranean case examines a specific kind of seasonal surplus--one caused by the seasonal phase shift between rainfall and evaporative demand in winter wet climates. while this is a commonly held view and has been examined in the past, this study offers the first explicit examination of this hypothesis with a large data set of evapotranspiration at the ecosystem level. hypothesis 3: grasslands have a lower evaporative index e p compared to forests of the same dryness index. this is expected because grasses are generally thought to have shallower root systems that lack access to the full storage of water in the vadose zone (unsaturated and saturated), and grasslands tend to have lower leaf area and associated interception capacity, and hence less direct evaporation of intercepted water. hypothesis 4: sites with a larger fraction of frozen precipitation have a lower evaporative index e p for a given dryness index. this derives from an expectation of potentially rapid, rain-on-snow driven runoff that might elevate losses during a time of year when vegetation is less actively drawing moisture from the root zone because of cool or cold temperatures."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which crops will be the most severely

second, this examination identifies critical gaps in both the ethics and policy literatures, and suggests areas in which each community could consider investing further attention. each policy has a unique combination of mechanisms used to express distribution rules and assumptions about the nature of the problem, but they share some aspects. first, all include causal responsibility, typically expressed through either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade mechanisms. variation in their inclusion of historical causality, or compensatory justice, will be discussed later. another aspect that almost all policies share is the use of multiple distribution rules. with only three exceptions, all the policies include two or more distribution rules; nine include three or more of the core principles. this suggests that policy designers may try to incorporate multiple perspectives of distributive justice to increase the likelihood of acceptance. justice clearly matters strategically when designing climate policy. this article has differentiated policies according to their application of distribution rules, their assumptions about the nature of the problem of climate change, and the corresponding mandate of climate policy. what is important is not only variation in proposals across these dimensions independently but also interaction between them in particular policies. interactions between these dimensions were used to generate three categories of climate policy. informed by the conceptual differences between equity, fairness and justice discussed earlier, these categories are equitable division of climate policy costs, fair distribution of the burden of economic costs and climate change impacts, and compensatory justice for policy costs and liability for climate change damages. the first category stresses equitable division of the burden of climate policy policies in this category are more likely to apply assumptions of high substitutability and use price mechanisms or safety-valve hybrids which aim to minimize economic costs but incur the risk of ecological costs. these policies also emphasize the 'equal burden' distribution rule in a context in which the metric is either financial or actual emission reductions. this is the only category which includes policies focused on proportional reductions based on existing emission levels as a strategy for calculating costs. this category also includes those policies aimed exclusively at high emitters. within these proposals the assistance for developing countries would be limited to technological transfer in exchange for mitigation. these policies define the burden of climate policy in terms of emission reductions and mitigation costs, and may not include human development or the impacts of climate change. technological development and transfer is central in this category. policies with only weak mechanisms for resource transfer but with heavy emphasis on technological development for 'clean' energy have been placed into this category, as are all those for which technology is the central driving force of policy. policies in this category are generally concerned about equitable burdensharing. the goal is to minimize and distribute the economic costs of climate policy equally among nations. policies in this category include those discussed by aldy et al.

applications, it acts like a \" natural experiment \" and thus in some settings allows researchers to identify statistically the causal effect of one variable on an economic outcome of interest (angrist and krueger 2001). the relatively recent literature on the economic impacts of climate change has turned the spotlight onto quantifying the effect of climate on a number of economic outcomes of interest (e.g., agricultural yields, mortality rates, electricity and water demand). this literature has often found a nonlinear relationship between climate and these outcomes, with extremely warm temperatures being especially important (e.g., schlenker and roberts 2009). climate is a long average of weather at a given location. to identify the causal effect of climate on these outcomes, the

these variations reflect hydroclimatic variability (that is, variations in temperature, precipitation, and runoff over various time scales). to expand on the historical record basis for planning, one planning response is to preserve the statistics of the instrumental record, while allowing for possible changes in the sequencing of conditions. this gives rise to the plausibility of developing synthetic hydroclimatic time series using stochastic modeling. doing so introduces an expanded set of planning assumptions about plausible droughts and other hydroclimatic extremes. generally speaking, stochastic development of hydroclimatic scenarios involves the following steps: (1) choosing a reference period from which hydroclimatic statistics will be preserved; (2) collecting data from the reference period; (3) building a stochastic model, perhaps using parametric (stedinger and taylor, 1982a,b; salas, 1993) or nonparametric techniques (lall and sharma, 1996); (4) verifying that the model preserves reference hydroclimate statistics and autocorrelation characteristics; and (\\\\x04) applying the model to generate synthetic hydrologic sequences for planning purposes. for this discussion, the emphasis is on step (1). the reference period must portray a climate that is still relevant for the planning future. the instrumental record offers one reference period to support stochastic modeling. other reference periods might be considered, including those from the paleoclimatic record (for example, evidence found in tree rings, sediment deposits, and sand dunes). other uses for the paleoclimatic record are discussed below. a variety of techniques have been developed to translate paleoclimatic data into hydroclimatic reconstructions (appendix a). for example, tree ring records have been used to reconstruct annual streamflow in various western u.s. basins. in general, these reconstructions are less reliable as indicators of past hydroclimatic magnitudes in any specific year and are instead more reliable as relative state indicators (that is, whether a reconstructed year was wet or dry relative to the reconstructed period median). such state information is particularly useful for planning when the affected decision is sensitive to system performance under drought or other sequence variation possibilities. this has motivated numerous water resource agencies to incorporate streamflow reconstructions based on tree rings into their planning assumptions about supply variability (woodhouse and lukas, 2006; bureau of reclamation, 2007). paleoclimatic information may indicate a wider range of hydroclimatic variability prior to instrumental records. determining the relevance of paleoclimatic information to support planning in today's changing climate remains a matter of research. such context also depends on recent climate trends and projected climate change that may exist outside of the climate envelope indicated by paleoclimatic information. given a choice to incorporate paleoclimatic information into planning, there are several ways in which such information can be used. one approach is to directly use the information for both reference climate statistics and sequencing. this involves the assumption that the hydroclimatic statistics and sequence from the reconstructed record are valid for future planning. a second approach might build on the first to include stochastic modeling to expand the set of sequence possibilities. each sequence would reflect the statistics of the reconstructed record but would offer different sequencing. a consequence of these approaches is that assumed runoff magnitudes (for example, monthly-to-annual volume possibilities) are a representation of the paleorecord. it may be preferred to have these magnitudes represent the instrumental record while retaining the sequence possibilities of the paleorecord. this gives rise to a third approach, where the stochastic model is first used to generate categorical sequences (for example, wet versus dry), and a second stage is used to associate runoff magnitudes from the instrumental record (bureau of reclamation, 2007)."},

active pool builds up in the atmosphere, at a current rate of around six extra billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. this overflow cannot go on indefinitely. if all the remaining fossil carbon were taken out of the ground and injected into the carbon pool on or near the surface, the earth would probably become uninhabitable (leggett, 1999). historically, global carbon-cycling capacity has been open to use by all, with no rules or laws applied except ones relating to pollutants that may accompany carbon dioxide. however, concern has grown that this capacity is both overused and unequally used. industrialized countries alone currently use far more of the absorptive capacity of the biosphere and atmosphere to stow their carbon emissions in than is 'available', with the

influenced by environmental change. the transmission patterns of these diseases may, therefore, be affected by ambient temperature. however, temperature is only one of many factors that influence transmission dynamics (figure 1). rodent-borne diseases do not always involve an arthropod host and are therefore less directly affected by temperature. transmission of these infections frequently depends on rodent population density and behavior, which, in turn, depend upon environmental conditions and available food. many vector-borne diseases are zoonoses caused by pathogens having nonhuman animals as their natural host. because they are not part of the natural transmission cycle, humans are only incidentally infected. zoonoses usually persist in nature in silent transmission cycles between vectors and nonhuman hosts, going undetected unless they spill over and infect the human population. in contrast, the anthropogenic vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria, require no animal host and are transmitted from human to human by mosquito vectors. although these disease-causing pathogens are now rare in the united states, their mosquito vectors are still

and the first multiscale deconstruction of beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components. mammal beta diversity across the whole of europe mainly reflects species turnover, with only a small contribution from nestedness. the turnover component geographically reflects that europe can be subdivided into six regions, each with a suite of characteristic species, namely northern europe, western and central europe, and eastern europe plus the three mediterranean regions, the iberian, italian, and balkan peninsulas. while there are minor differences, these clusters are broadly consistent with those identified by heikinheimo et al. 2007 despite the different clustering approaches used in that study. our results provide some support for all four hypothesized drivers, suggesting that beta diversity of mammals in europe may be a product of their joint effects. current climate clearly constitutes an important driver of mammal beta diversity in europe. there is strong continental-scale turnover, especially in north-south direction, as predicted from the strong latitudinal climate gradient; and, more directly, climate was a strong correlate of species composition. similarly, european mammal species distributions have recently been found to be well explained by current climate (dormann et al. 2010). large-scale beta diversity patterns have also been linked to climate for other organism groups and areas (e.g., buckley jetz 2008), including mammals in north america (qian, badgley fox 2009). furthermore, our results indicate an important role for climate at smaller scales; the strongest correlate of species turnover within the 250 000-km2regions is topographic heterogeneity, itself strongly correlated with within-region climatic variation. again, topographic heterogeneity has also been identified as the main driver of mammal beta diversity across the new world at a similar scale (neighbouring 1  grid cells; melo, rangel diniz-filho 2009). the

technological exchange for mitigation. they also could result in more expensive policies and risk protecting future generations at the cost of the current one. the extent of this category suggests considerable interest in finding a middle ground between human development and technical cost-effective mitigation. there is a natural tendency to leverage existing development programmes to support human development needs in this category of policy. this would also have significant distributive justice impacts, necessitating further analyses of policies in this category. the final and smallest category, compensatory justice for the costs of climate policy and liability for climate impacts envisions the most extreme resource redistribution and is the only category that takes compensation seriously for distributive justice. under this framework, it is likely that developing countries would receive substantial resources beyond the transfer of technology. at this time, however, these policies could be the most costly financially and politically, as debate about measuring historical causation, costs and benefits is likely. such debate carries costs of time and energy, which should

malaria, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue fever will become increasingly widespread. in some cases, extreme events, such as heavy rains, will wash away eggs and larvae and decrease vector populations. mosquitoes responsible for malaria will grow, by accessing warm high altitudes, in places once free of the disease.36 lindsay and martens37 have used models and scenarios to estimate that

et al. (1993) claimed that when greenland was cold the subpolar north atlantic ssts were also cold, although low sedimentation rates made the time resolution of the core too imprecise for easy cross comparison with the greenland record. sachs and lehman (1999) presented records from the bermuda rise, a region of high sedimentation that allows for good temporal resolution. the agreement between the d18o proxy for sst and the greenland record through numerous abrupt climate changes during the last glacial is startling (figure 2): whenever greenland is cold, the subtropical north atlantic ocean is cold too. while it is true that this conclusion partly depends on the fact that the age control on the bermuda record was fitted in order to maximize the correspondence between the two records, the fact that it is possible to get such a high correspondence testifies to a real link between climate changes in these two locations. lea et al. (2003) used mg/ca ratios to reconstruct ssts above the cariaco basin, a region of annually laminated sediments north of venezuela, during the last deglaciation. they found an abrupt warming at the

that adaptation costs are likely to be in the order of tens of billions of dollars per annum within a few years, and that the reliability of these estimates is low. there are urgent questions around these estimates. how much climate resilience is built into the assumptions? what baseline of current costs is calculated or assumed? what level of risk reduction is provided for? and so on. in three short chapters, written by ten authors and edited by two of them, this slim volume moves beyond cost estimation to the potential and limits of economic and policy instruments. the bottom-line question is: what can best be done to motivate and facilitate adaptation actions? the essays address insurance and risk sharing, environmental markets and pricing, and public-private partnerships. chapter 1 places the issue of adaptation costs into a broader economic and policy context. chapter 2 provides a good critical review of many of the actual estimates that have been made, and chapter 3 describes a number of economic and policy instruments to promote adaptation. the book is an excellent primer for those seeking to assess the use-value of cost estimates for adaptation, in helping to inform global negotiations under the unfccc and for the donor and developing countries that are seeking ways to 'mainstream' climate change adaptation into development strategies, policies and measures. it is not a how-to-do-it book. rather, it is a provocative and challenging exercise in raising questions to which there are, for the moment, no satisfactory answers; nor does it offer any immediate prospect of finding robust answers. the book's greatest value to this reviewer is that it engenders serious reflection on whether the right questions are being asked at all. adaptation runs a whole gamut of approaches from placeand project-specific, through sectoral policies and measures, to grand national strategies. for example, in bangladesh, one might ask about the costs and benefits of adaptation in a single coastal-zone defence project against sea-level rise and enhanced cyclonic storm intensity. at the next level one might ask what the costs would be of providing an 'adequate' or 'acceptable' level of protection of rice cultivation in large regions subject to droughts, floods or increased salinity. on a larger scale one should also probably ask (although the question is itself unwelcome) what the economic cost implications might be of abandoning the palliative in-situ adaptation that is currently favoured in the lowest-lying and most exposed delta lands, in favour of what seems to be the inevitable relocation sooner or later of millions - perhaps tens of millions - of coastal zone dwellers. the legitimate economic dimensions of these sorts of questions need to be addressed. but what purpose is served by lumping them all together under the rubric of 'the costs or the economics of adaptation'? surely the concept of adaptation as it is currently being used is far too vague and all-encompassing to try to address in a holistic way. you might as well ask, what is the cost of sustainable development?"}, {"qas": [{"question": "The is the C2 circle born?", "id":

legislation is the best venue. scholarship on lock-in identifies various policy access points from where path-dependent trajectories have emerged, including sub-national jurisdiction, different policy-making units at a given level of government, and different levels or orders of policy. it may be that policy makers avoid anti-majority filibustering in the us senate by focusing on congressional committees that often address highly relevant, though less studied, calibrations and settings. again, rabe's analysis of us climate policy documents many cases where efforts to promote large-scale legislative changes failed, but, a range of smaller scale policies, many at the state level, took advantage of windows of opportunity that appear to have created some degree of stickiness. it is important to note that stickiness, by itself, is unable to address the super wicked problem of climate change. if delaying costs explains support, then whether, when, and how the intervention might be successful depends on what path-dependent processes might also be unleashed. it is, therefore, critical that policy makers also attend to the second and third diagnostic questions discussed

coalitions and values, deeply held views about right and wrong by segments of society, or policy norms that define and regulate appropriate behavior in particular circumstances. both are initially

practice, the renewal of biomass also depends on its management, which should ensure that primary resources are not overexploited or even depleted. if resource management is technically appropriate, environmentally non-degrading,socially favourable and economically viable, then the renewable resource will be exploited in a sustainable4way. the issue of sustainability being crucial in the field of bioenergy,the un executive board for clean development mechanisms released in december 2006 an o ffi cial definition of \"renewable biomass\" including this sustainability dimension (unfccc, 2006 ). among the five possible conditions where biomass can be defined as \"renewable\", the three that do not deal with residues or wastes have a first criterion mentioning that the land use shall not change except if land areas are reverted to forest. the second criterion implicitly linked to the first one states: \"sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically decrease over time\". this is a key element when comparing the co2 emissions from biofuels and fossil fuels. indeed, the interesting fundamental carbon neutrality of combusted biomass is based on the fact that the emitted co2 from the plant originates from the atmosphere where it eventually goes back to. if land conversion to biomass production implies additional co2 emission through soil organic carbon losses, it may o ff set this carbon neutrality. highly dependent on the type of vegetation, the organic carbon stock is globally around 1.6 times higher in forest or permanent grassland soils than in crop soils (antoni and arrouays, 2007 ). therefore, land-use change can lead to soil organic matter losses. soil organic carbon content can also decrease in the long term as a consequence of the export of agricultural residues. therefore, it is necessary to assess the net crop residue amount that would remain available for the bioenergy chain without degrading the soil quality in the long term (sa ffi h-hdadi and mary, 2008 gabrielle and gagnaire, 2008 ). soil organic matter represents only a few percent of the total soil mass, but still constitutes a large organic carbon stock on a global scale, i.e. almost the same as the sum of the carbon stocks in the atmosphere and in the vegetation (arrouays et al., 2002 ). small but stable changes in this stock could critically impact the global carbon fluxes. furthermore, soil organic matter plays a crucial role in soil quality. in an agricultural soil, whose main function is to provide nutrients and water to crops, soil organic matter permits the development of microorganisms decomposing organic matter into easy-absorbed mineral forms for the plant. it contributes to the soil cationic exchange capacity, which also influences the availability of essential minerals for the plant, and to the stability of the soil. soil organic matter and forest biodiversity are among the precious resources whose conservation for future generations should not be jeopardised by land-use changes. for the producers, \"renewable

that glof risks should not pose excessive barriers to hydropower developments. planners, donors, and investors should undertake risk assessments and work to understand how glofs and climate change can be managed. some participants were concerned that the idea of climate change and glofs would lead some people to automatically rule out large hydropower plants. one advantage of large hydropower discussed during the consultative workshop is that reservoirs can provide dependable flows for electricity generation, supplement water supplies for domestic and agriculture uses during the dry season, and if properly designed, they may play a role in flood management. these possible benefits must be carefully weighed any against environmental impacts and the enhanced glof risks. thorough

depends on a wide range of factors other than changes to global energy policy. and in some cases, energy policy is far from an important element in more effective outcomes in these areas. consequently, a common interest objective of climate policy would be to improve societal and environmental resilience to climate, independent of the causes of variability and change. 6.2. energy policy decoupling climate policy from energy policy would not mean that the nations of the world should then forget about the climate effects of greenhouse gas emissions. to the contrary, a new approach might even offer an opportunity to address energy policy in a more comprehensive manner, focusing on pollution, efficiency, and independence, thereby perhaps removing the barrier of scientific uncertainty and creating a broader justification for early action. a return to energy efficiency and conservation as a central organizing theme for global energy policy would diminish the

euphotic zone", "answer_start": 1303}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "changes in abundance are more difficult to attribute to global warming than are shifts in distribution or phenology, although they may have greater ecosystem ramifications. one of the most striking examples of changes in abundance in response to longterm warming is from foraminifera in the california current (field et al ., 2006). foraminifera are ideal for long-term climate change studies because their populations are controlled more by changes in climate and primary productivity than by changes in predation, and they are also well preserved in sediments. as a result, their temporal dynamics can be linked to changes in climate over long time-scales. throughout the 20th century, the number of tropical subtropical species has been increasing, reflecting a warming trend; this phenomenon is most dramatic after the 1960s (figure 6). this change towards tropical foraminifera echoes similar increases in abundance of many other subtropical and tropical taxa and decreases in temperate algae, zooplankton, fish, and seabirds in the california current over the past few decades. an illustration from the northeast atlantic highlights the effect that global warming can have on stratification and plankton abundances, and emphasizes the region-specific consequences (richardson and schoeman, 2004). here, phytoplankton become more abundant with warming of cool, windy, and well-mixed regions, probably because warmer temperatures boost metabolic rates and enhance stratification, thereby increasing the amount of time phytoplankton cells spend in the euphotic zone. however, phytoplankton become less abundant when already warm regions get even warmer, probably because warmer surface water blocks further nutrient-rich deep water from rising to the euphotic layer. this regional phytoplankton response is transmitted up the plankton foodweb to herbivorous copepods and carnivorous zooplankton. therefore, over long timeand broad space scales, plankton foodwebs are controlled from the \"bottom up\" by primary producers, rather than from the \"top down\" by predators. because the amount of phytoplankton and zooplankton in a region is likely to influence the carrying capacity of fish (ware and thompson, 2005), the response to climate change of lower trophic levels suggests that the abundance and distribution of fish will change in the future, having regional impacts on fisheries. most evidence of climate impacts on zooplankton is from the northern hemisphere because this is where most (plankton) science is concentrated, but nevertheless, there have been dramatic changes documented from waters elsewhere. since the 1970s, there has been a decline in krill euphausia superba biomass in the southern ocean and a concomitant increase in salps, which occupy less productive and warmer regions (atkinson et al ., 2004). it is likely that these changes are a consequence of global warming. strong summer phytoplankton blooms and winters of extensive sea ice, with plentiful food from ice algae, enhance survival of krill larvae as well as recruitment to adult stocks. as waters have warmed, the extent of winter sea ice and its duration have declined, which is likely to have impaired larval krill survival and explains the observed decline in krill density. warmer waters also provide more favourable habitat for salps. the declining population abundance of krill could be deleterious to the populations of baleen whales, fish, penguins, seabirds, and seals that depend on krill as their primary food source. probably the zooplankton that people are most familiar with in their daily lives are jellyfish. jellyfish outbreaks have a host of societal consequences: loss of tourist revenue through beach closures and even death of bathers; blockage of coastal power plant cooling intakes, forcing electricity shutdowns; damage to fish nets and contamination of catches; interference with acoustic fish assessments; mortalities among farmed fish; and reduced commercial fish abundance through competition and predation. although dense jellyfish aggregations are a natural feature of figure 6. fluxes of planktonic foraminifera in santa barbara basin sediments. top panel shows increased abundances of tropical- subtropical foraminifera in the 20th century. bottom panel

haas and others (gough and shackley 2001; litfin 1994) have argued stem from their professional culture and expertise. so an epistemic community perspective directs our attention to the professional culture and training of accountants, and the links between this culture and expertise and their beliefs about how to mitigate climate change, in turn reflected in detailed policy proposals. there is a notable contrast here with governmentality approaches which direct our attention more towards the day-to-day practices and techniques of government. nevertheless the two theories are complementary through their shared interest in expertise - whether that be associated with routine, widespread practices (governmentality) or collective pooling and application of knowledge (epistemic

infrastructure. this includes all-season roads, airstrips and some short-line rail operations, such as the omnitrax line to the port of churchill in manitoba. degradation of permafrost as a result of

capacity. paved runways are likely to be among the structures most vulnerable to permafrost changes, as they readily absorb solar energy, further contributing to surface warming. ice roads, which are constructed by clearing a route across frozen ground, lakes or rivers, play an important role in northern transportation, both for community supply and for resource industries (figure 2). although the

as for developing projections of future climate change.10a key component of the models is their ability to simulate realistically many aspects of climate. a half century of model development has led to a suite of global climate models that have become ever more comprehensive physically. figure 2 shows improvement in their spatial resolution over the past two decades.11 many kinds of observations have demonstrated that the climate is warming. atmospheric temperatures are measured at surface sites and by networks of balloon-borne instruments and satellites. those data all show warming. ocean temperatures are measured from ships, satellites, buoys, and subsurface floats. all show warming. in fact, most of the heat added to the climate system in recent decades is in the ocean. sea level is rising globally. mass loss from glaciers, arctic sea ice, and the ice sheets on greenland and antarctica also indicate a warming climate. an entire branch of climate science, known as detection and attribution, is devoted to determining whether any particular class of observations represents a significant departure from natural variability and, if so, to identifying the cause. \"detection\" here refers to the task of distinguishing changes in climate due to some external cause from changes that could be expected from known modes of natural climate variability such as el nino and la nina. for changes not compatible with natural variability, \"attribution\" denotes the task of determining what external factor is responsible. extensive research has shown that the dominant observed changes in the climate system are consistent with the responses expected from increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. they are inconsistent with any natural external forcing mechanisms such as volcanism or changes in the sun. the fingerprint of human activity is thus clearly revealed in the magnitude and pattern of the observed climate changes. another good example of recent progress in climate science is our improved understanding of the increase in sea level to be expected as earth continues to warm. sea levels rise in a warming world for several distinct reasons. one is simple thermal expansion of ocean water. another is melting glaciers, and a third is the contribution from the melting of the gigantic ice sheets on greenland and antarctica. the 2007 ipcc report projected a global average rise in sea level of 18-59 cm by the end of this century, depending on different models and different scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions. the report stressed that thermal expansion contributed 70-75% of the central estimates for all the scenarios. it warned that melt water from the antarctic and greenland ice sheets might contribute significantly to sea-level rise. but the report's quantitative projections did not include those contributions because \"understanding of these effects is too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate\" (reference 1, page 14). in the years since 2007, however, climate science has advanced.12new technology has been brought to bear. for example, the grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites, launched in 2002, have used tiny variations in earth's gravity to infer changes in the masses of the antarctic and greenland ice sheets. several years of grace results and other data now show conclusively that both ice sheets are losing mass and contributing to global sea-level rise. the physical processes involved in mass loss are complex; they include surface melt, glacier flow, and snowfall. much remains to be learned. greenland and antarctica differ in important respects. but the contributions of both to sea-level rise are clearly increasing with time. if recent trends continue, their ice-sheet losses are expected to dominate global sea-level rise before the century ends. this century's sea-level rise is now estimated by some researchers to be as great as 1 to 2 meters.12 such conclusions must be effectively communicated to policy makers and the public."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which factors of positionality in society play an important role in differentiated judgments of climate

variables) may play an important role in these differentiated judgments of climate change by various groups, but evidence about how much of a difference it makes in different contexts is not uniform. the observed perceptions also explicitly accounts for ethical and moral dimensions, such as those relating to equity, development, and economic power. climate change is perceived through the lenses of pre-existing cultural worldviews. this means that perception of the issue is strongly determined by beliefs held by individuals about the functioning of nature and what would constitute a 'good life', fairness, and the appropriate role of individuals versus markets and the government. accordingly, evidence from developed countries on differences in individuals' perceptions converges on systematically varying levels of concern, the presence of skeptical views in all societies studied, and some degree of acceptance, ranging from solid to tempered. perception of climate change is also shaped by the framing used in climate change communications, particularly the imagery and stories employed, which can help increase knowledge and concern if the embedded emotions do not overly emphasize (i.e., manipulate) negative feelings such as fear, guilt or hopelessness. negative affective appeals seem largely counterproductive, especially when unaccompanied by messages that build listeners' sense of efficacy, hope, and optimism about the future. how climate change is framed can fundamentally affect how the issue is perceived. for example, appeals to parenthood and hero's stories, such as that found in the film ' the day after tomorrow ', can shape perception, but such demographic variables, including parenthood, do not show consistent evidence for people's concern and intentions to reduce personal emissions. moreover, concern about climate change does not necessarily stem from having been affected by the effects of climate change directly; in fact, evidence is inconclusive as to whether those directly impacted by events such as floods are as or more likely than others to attempt mitigation of ghg. some limited evidence suggests that individuals openly acknowledge a responsibility, either moral or civic, for addressing climate change. while one may hypothesize that notions of responsibility and motivation to act are similarly shaped by the deeply

motivations for investments in understanding the full range of climate change impacts. the motivation is especially strong, however, for the ecosystem impacts that feed back to climate change, either amplifying or suppressing the initial forcing. throughout the history of climate change science, ecosystem feedbacks have played a major role in scientific and public debates, with some arguments that responses of terrestrial ecosystems largely eliminate the risk of dangerous climate change (1) and others that ecosystem responses increase that risk (2). both kinds of argument are supported by reasonable conceptual frameworks. a very large body of observational, experimental, and theoretical work increasingly allows these arguments to be replaced with detailed analysis. but there are still important gaps in our understanding. several of the potentially key mechanisms have not been studied in detail and are either absent from or sketchily represented in models. here, we summarize the available information and make a preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of poorly known mechanisms. climate change responses of terrestrial ecosystems can feed back to climate through two broad mechanisms figure 1 ). one is modulating the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases (ghgs) (3), especially carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), and nitrous oxide (n2o). the other is modulating the absorption or distribution of solar energy in the atmosphere or at the land surface (4). as with most of the processes in earth's system, ecosystem feedbacks are complicated by four important factors. first, they rarely occur in isolation, and their implications are typically amplified or suppressed by a wide range of other mechanisms. second, they occur over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, with very different implications on different scales. third, they potentially influence diverse aspects of climate, ranging from global-scale temperature to local precipitation intensity. and fourth, they are intimately involved with human actions, both as drivers and responders. over the past three decades, most of the research on feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change has focused on their potential role as carbon sources or sinks. the conclusion that atmospheric co2 was growing more slowly than expected, on the basis of estimated

the flooding of a dike, or a rainfall that exceeds the capacity of a sewer system over the design life period. we propose a concept, design life level, which does this. in it one simply specifies the design life period and the probability of exceeding an extreme/hazardous level during this period. a complementary variant, the minimax design life level, instead specifies the maximal risk of failure during any one year in the design life period. in addition, risk plots, which show how the probability of failure changes over the design life period, are often useful, and sometimes also constant risk plots, which for each year in the design life period show the level that is exceeded with a given specified probability. nevertheless, the probability of failure over the design life period, as specified to determine the design life level, remains the most informative single quantity for risk characterization and communication. if one is not aiming primarily at design, but just wants to illustrate the extent of changes, simpler concepts may sometimes suffice. in particular, laurent and parey [2007] use a nonstationary version of the 100-year return level, and vogel et al [2011]

have insisted throughout the discussion, from a serious analysis of ethics, and from incorporating risk and analysis based on modern science. much of the earlier economics literature has been remiss

unleashing a range of path-dependent processes. the bc government undertook two strategies that are consistent with our framework's attention to entrenching (dq2) and expanding (dq3) coalitions. first, it took advantage of its strong ties with business interests by developing a revenue neutral tax policy14which fostered swift entrenchment through increasing returns by benefiting a core constituency.15second, calibrations focused on sharing tax revenues with municipalities and school boards that had committed to carbon neutrality (harrison 2009 ). these policies, whether intended or not, created increasing returns logics aimed at an expanded population, which in turn, we can plausibly expect to have positive feedbacks on the original supporters. the decision to tie these taxes to school boards also created additional stickiness through coalition building since municipalities and schools would lose considerable revenues if the tax was ever rescinded. beyond these strategies, our approach offers additional ideas that the government could have considered. for instance, there is a plausible logic that the coalition would have been further nurtured by communicating to populations the increasing returns benefits they might enjoy, but of which they might not have been immediately aware. by making more obvious the link between the carbon tax increases and cuts in personal income taxes, such communication might have reduced pockets of societal opposition, which the opposition party exploited.16there is evidence these lessons are being applied by some policy makers adopting the framing of ''capanddividend'' rather than ''cap-and-trade.'' whether the efforts of the california air resources board and the bc tax will prove effective will, in part, be answered by whether other interventions can be nurtured to intersect in ways that create increasing returns and positive feedback processes within these jurisdictions, north america, and globally. the point here is that policy makers must not only work to influence multiple jurisdictions, but also multiple access points that might"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is explain about the FIG. 12?", "id":

"although an accelerated development potentially gives an important benefit for the insect species, this change in phenology might have some serious drawbacks. in insect herbivores, phenological synchrony between host plant development and insect life stages is often essential for developmental success (van asch visser 2007). it is especially true for host-specific insects overwintering as eggs, such as a number of lepidopterans defoliating trees and shrubs, which need neonates hatching in spring to be precisely timed with plant budburst. because the lower temperature thresholds for resuming development following winter might differ between the host plant and the associated insect, an increase in temperature is likely to affect their respective growth rates differently. such a mismatch between vegetative budburst and hatching of larvae has already been observed over the past 2 decades for the system oak-winter moth, opheroptera brumata (l.), where the egg hatch date has advanced more than the bud burst date of pedunculate oak (visser both 2005). similar observations have been made for sycamore and its associated aphid, drepanosiphum platanoides koch. (dixon 2003). winter and spring temperatures unusually warm for the period 1989-1991 might also have disrupted the strict synchrony previously existing between hatching of larch budmoth larvae, zeiraphera diniana guenee, and larch foliage availability (esper et al 2007). this could be a major reason of the unexpected collapse observed during the 1990s in the cycle of this insect, which was regularly outbreaking every 8-10 years in the alps for hundreds of years (battisti 2008). further increase in temperature is predicted to induce long-term perturbations in the zeiraphera larch system, with a possible induced shift of intense outbreak areas towards higher altitudes (buntgen et al 2009). however, disrupted synchrony will lead to selection, and a response in phenology to this selection might lead to species genetically adapting to their changing environment. in the case of the winter moth cited above, van asch et al (2007) show that egg-hatching reaction norms are heritable and that sufficient genetic variation exists to predict a rapid response to selection, leading to a restoration of synchrony of egg hatch with oak bud opening."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What

knowledge on why barriers emerge and how they might be addressed is still quite limited. an important next step now is to go beyond describing and enumerating barriers towards explaining them, to provide clear and valid analyses leading to identification of entry points and strategies for intervention. although studies occasionally indicate the importance of a dynamic perspective and consideration of causal interdependencies among barriers, these issues are yet rarely researched in an explicit way. the huge diversity of actors and contexts between single cases is clearly a major challenge in this regard. this section elaborates these research themes further and makes methodological suggestions. first, consider interdependency. some case studies mention a co-occurrence (or 'clustering') of multiple barriers19,30,57. this reflects that the barrier categories discussed above are sometimes independent of each other. but in many cases they are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are often interdependent. some barriers from different categories co-occur or reinforce each other; some 'remote' and less obvious barriers can cause proximate barriers to adaptation. few studies have attempted to trace back the apparent or proximate set of conditions impeding adaptation to the underlying causes of why or how these conditions have arisen and why they endure6,11. for example, unresolved conflicts between the involved actors' goals can be a proximate impediment to adaptation27,28. but what is the root cause of such conflicts? a conflict may arise from multiple actors being affected by the same climate change impacts and adaptations in different ways. alternatively, the impacts can cause resource scarcity as a root of conflict, if accompanied by a lack of institutionalized mechanisms for conflict resolution. when two barriers are interdependent, it is not always obvious which of them underlies the other. we argue that understanding the interdependencies of barriers is central for explaining their occurrence, persistence and resolution. it is also crucial from a practical viewpoint. policies or approaches to reduce or overcome barriers might prove to be ineffective if they disregard causal interdependencies, while a welldesigned intervention can simultaneously address multiple related barriers. it might also be necessary to address multiple interdependent barriers in parallel. second, consider dynamics. several components in the proposed definition of barriers to adaptation (see above) can be dynamic: the actors involved and the actions under consideration; the institutional, socioeconomic and -- of course -- climatic context of the involved actors; and the value judgements of actors. dynamics may be the result of historical events, contingent factors or specific interventions, or they may be the consequence of specific interdependencies among barriers. overlapping with the interdependency theme detailed above, the degree of mutual interaction can also change over time. some barriers might reinforce or balance other barriers over time. for example, interlinked barriers may lead to vicious or virtuous cycles64, either mutually enforcing or mitigating"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the necessary resource for both herbiores and wildfires,  where they both interact and compete for it?", "id":

natural range of variability. thus, management toward ecosystem reconciliation (rosenzweig, 2003) has become a more realistic goal than restoration toward some earlier state. patterns of change are complex, and the challenge of unraveling the causes of ecosystem change is daunting in the coastal zone where human pressures are concentrated and effects of climate variability over land intersect with different effects over ocean basins. complexity also arises from the barely-understood synergistic effects of multiple processes such as nutrient enrichment, species s, fishing and changing climate. thus, effective management of coastal ecosystems requires a holistic systems perspective grounded in research to discover how multiple processes operate together to bring about transformative change. discoveries that come uniquely from sustained observations must play a central role in this research. observational programs also reveal how estuaries function as systems where all component parts - habitats, connections to land and ocean, biological communities and biogeochemical processes - are tightly interlinked. changes in one have effects that ramify throughout the system. this

the objective of producing weakly constrained parameter vectors, resulting in a wide range of plausible climate states, centred upon the modern climate state. the complex precalibration procedure was required in view of the broad input ranges applied to 25 parameterisations, attempting to jointly address the major sources of uncertainty in each of the four modelled earth system components; whilst only 1% of the 1,000 simulations from a maximin latin hypercube design satisfied modern plausibility, more than 90% of simulations satisfied this requirement after the abc-emulator filtering. the resulting parameter set is likely to have potential genie-1 applications elsewhere. the range of responses exhibited by genie-1 with this parameter set encompasses most of the behaviour seen in multi-model gcm ensembles, notably displaying uncertainty in the sign of the change in atlantic overturning in response to lgm boundary conditions. this suggests that the uncertainty in the response seen in gcms may derive from parametric uncertainty rather than reflecting fundamental differences between models. the emulation of climate sensitivity enables us to investigate the contribution of individual parameters to uncertainty. whilst the uncertainty is unsurprisingly dominated by the atmosphere (+-0.93degc), uncertainties in vegetation contribute +-0.32degc, with ocean +-0.24degc and

interconnection between present climate change and consequences on marine ecosystems and their function. in the past, viruses and prokaryotes have been considered in large-scale global oceanic models as a 'black box'. we know now that viruses play a pivotal role in the functioning of both pelagic and benthic ecosystems, influencing microbial food webs, controlling prokaryotic diversity and impacting biogeochemical cycles. clearly, a better understanding of their response to present climate change would enhance our ability to predict and adapt to the consequences of such changes. traditionally, the evaluation of the effects of climate change on natural systems is conducted by the analysis of paleoecological and stratigraphic records or by the analysis of longterm data sets that permit the identification of the relationships between climatic conditions and the spreading or decline of specific biological components. these approaches are impossible in the field of the viral ecology as we are not aware of any evidence of fossil viruses and we do not have long-term data for this important component of marine systems. it is also unclear whether viruses, under the present scenarios of climate change, will ultimately stabilize or destabilize the dynamics of the living components of ecosystems and their biogeochemical cycles. therefore, we cannot yet predict whether the viruses will exacerbate or smooth the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems. the approach used here, based on the presentation of specific relevant case studies, and on the meta-analysis of the available literature information on an array of changes in viral assemblages, allows us an initial examination of possible coming changes in our worlds' oceans. given the knowledge gained from previous documented research studies, we also provide some speculation on scenarios that could occur if the current projections of climate change will result in actual changes in terms of surface and deep-water temperatures, productivity, stratification, salinity and acidification. from the case studies analyzed, it appears that the effect of rising surface water temperatures on viruses will be significant, influencing both the metabolism and growth efficiency of the prokaryotes and altering the viral life cycles. however, it is apparent that different effects will be observed at different latitudes and in different oceanic regions. for instance, data reported here led to hypothesize that higher temperature will promote the viral component at high latitudes and depress it at the tropics. however, because the mosaic of environmental changes will be different in each biogeographic region, we stress the need of future studies aimed at addressing the impact of climate change on regional and global scales. the scenario of freshening at the poles will likely increase the input and spread of freshwater groups of viruses and bacteria into marine systems, along with increasing opportunity for crossing over of marine and freshwater taxa. marine viruses can influence the metabolic balance of heterotrophic prokaryotes, inducing shifts in pelagic ecosystems function. however, it is unclear whether the viral shunt will ultimately have positive or negative effects on the efficiency of the biological pump, and consequently, the feedback effects of marine ecosystems on climate. in both alternatives presented here, the role of viruses on the carbon export to the ocean interior is potentially crucial and has to be considered and addressed, especially within global climate models. viruses have the potential to interact with the climate through their contribution to the marine biogenic particles of the aerosol and by contributing to the release of dms through the lysis of their autotrophic hosts. these processes have to be quantified and included in modeling studies dealing with the ocean-atmosphere interactions. the omzs are predicted to expand in the future ocean because of climate change, with important consequences on biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus and on the distribution of organisms. because eukaryotic herbivores and bacterivores are more sensitive than prokaryotes to the reduction in oxygen levels, it can be expected that virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes will increase at the expense of protists and other bacterivores. expanding omzs will also lead to an increase in the frequency of anoxic sediments and thus potentially the global role of viruses in benthic prokaryotic dynamics. the effects of ocean acidification on marine viruses are uncertain, but we can anticipate that the most dramatic changes will be due to the effects of ph on the host organisms that the viruses rely on bacteria, archaea, protists and metazoa, which are highly ph dependent. moreover, because some key metabolic processes of the microbial communities are highly sensitive (and inhibited) by even small decreases in the ph of the medium, ocean acidification may have a profound influence on the overall functioning of the microbial communities and on virus- host interactions. the case studies presented here suggest that marine viruses will be significantly influenced by climate change and that, in turn, viruses could influence processes contributing to climate change. current ocean climate models are severely limited by the ability to include important biological components and to specify the temporal and spatial"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Thirty-three scientists and 92 crew members sailed from

areas of the cotswolds. the aim was to work in depth and to develop a rich or 'thick' understanding of a relatively small sample with a broadly shared social position rather than conduct a questionnaire survey, for example, which would have allowed a 'thinner' exploration of a much more diverse sample. it could be argued that the sample is diverse in terms of their marital status, that having always remained single and childless is very different to having been married, or having had children within or outside marriage. to treat all participants as members of the category 'single' may conceal important differences. clearly there are differences in the kind of accounting and relationship history that women give, and we will be exploring these elsewhere. in this article we are looking at particular commonalities that appeared across the sample. appendix 1 shows some of the variation in statuses and allows readers to see how we reached our conclusions in relation to the data that we discuss. all of the interviews were conducted on a one-to-one basis with the exception of one group discussion with four women. interviews lasted between one and half and two hours and were usually conducted in participants' own homes. the researcher was able to interview with the status, to some extent, of an 'insider' (adler and adler, 1987). as noted, she identified herself as a single woman, and shared some features such as cultural and class background with many of the sample. we hoped that this shared culture would avoid reproducing the situation noted in the where women who define themselves as single are constantly put on the spot to explain their 'oddity'. while we generally refer to those interviewed as 'participants', we recognize that the researcher was also a participant in the discussion and the resulting discourse was jointly constructed. a schedule of questions was prepared for use in what can be described as the 'guided but informal conversation' of the interview. participants were provided with an outline of topic areas in advance, and were asked to complete a form relating to personal details. interviews were taped and transcribed. the transcripts have been anonymized, with names changed and details which might lead to identification of the person removed. participants were provided with a copy of their own transcript and offered the opportunity to correct or delete material. the interview topics covered three broad areas. the first area also served as a general the researcher asked about the images participants held of singleness and how they perceived others' views of themselves. the second area focused on the participant's past and current relationships. the final questions aimed to revisit the participant's current feelings about her situation, and to elicit any political perspectives she might hold regarding the single state. in this paper, we focus on discourse drawn mainly from the first area and in particular the sample's responses to three questions: 1. 'how do you prefer to describe yourself?' this question usually followed an initial question asking the participant to give a brief description of herself and picked up on whether singleness was mentioned and what words were used in that brief description. 2. 'what images of singleness do you recall having when younger?' this was commonly accompanied by a follow up question - 'what does singleness mean to you now?' 3. 'how do you think other people see singleness?'

spawn in fresh water (elliott, 1994). as it shows such a wide variation in size, s. trutta is an ideal subject for studying the complexity of factors affecting its growth. in his comprehensive review of growth in fishes, ricker (1979) emphasized the importance of developing mathematical models for growth. he showed that the early growth models were empirical equations fitting a course of growth in relation to time or age, usually at annual intervals, e.g. von bertalanffy, gompertz, johnson and richards growth curves. more than one model will often be found to describe satisfactorily the same set of observations, especially when applied to annual growth. these models also assume that growth is asymptotic, i.e. the size of a fish will tend towards some fixed limit no matter how long a fish lives. this assumption is clearly invalid for salmonids. ricker (1979) concluded that more realistic models are required to describe growth over short periods of time and thus to determine if fishes are growing at their maximum potential. it is 35 years since a predictive model was developed for the growth of s. trutta (elliott, 1975). this model has now been used to investigate growth in at least 40 populations of s. trutta in most populations, the fish were growing at or below their maximum potential with only a few populations in which they grew faster than the maximum rates predicted

to be evaluated. further, this approach integrates well with a goal of considering current and historic refugia, as many of the same characteristics and principles apply. it is easily used in conjunction with existing species or habitat features, and doing so is unlikely to reduce the efficiency of the conservation planning process. one advantage of the conserving the stage approach is that it does not resist change, but rather anticipates ecological and evolutionary dynamism and uses our understanding of how biodiversity is generated to maximize the opportunity for future diversity. protecting climatic refugia in many ecosystems, climate change is already leading to rapid ecological change that can be construed as negative for biodiversity conservation (e.g., bleaching events for coral reefs--berkelmans et al. 2004 drought-related mortality of pinus edulis in the southwestern united states--breshears et al. 2005 ). because the probability, speed, type, and extent of these changes is unlikely to be uniform across a region, a relatively straight forward and intuitive approach to adaptation in regional conservation plans is to focus on identifying and protecting biodiversity in those areas least likely to undergo rapid climateinduced changes. such places may serve as important climate refugia for species and habitats that become marginalized through ecological changes elsewhere. climate refugia can exist both in places where changes in climate are attenuated (e.g., saxon 2008 ), or where biodiversity is likely to be particularly robust to changes in climate, perhaps due to a broad climate tolerance (e.g., west and salm 2003 ). for example, as part of a national conservation plan for papua new guinea (png), game et al. 2011 identified climate refugia based on projected changes in seven climate dependent variables (potential evapotranspiration, precipitation/potential evapotranspiration, precipitation of the coldest quarter of the year, precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year, mean temperature of the coldest quarter of the year, mean temperature of the warmest quarter of the year, and average monthly temperature) (fig. 2 ). the current value for these variables in 5-km pixels was compared with their projected value in the year 2100, and the expected change normalised with the value 1 being assigned to the pixel expected to experience the greatest climatic change across png. there are multiple ways to define refugia from climate change, and different definitions require different methods of identification and data inputs. ashcroft 2010 recommends that discussions of refugia explicitly distinguish between macrorefugia and microrefugia (i.e., the scale at which refugia are being identified, and therefore what resolution climate data are necessary or appropriate), in situ and ex situ refugia (whether refugia from future climate change are likely to be located within or outside of a species' current distribution), and refugia based on climatic versus habitat stability. the issue of scale is particularly important as it has been shown to influence patterns of species richness and species turnover, particularly as they relate to changes along environmental gradients (jetz and rahbeck 2002 ). for example, species turnover in amphibians and birds is closely linked to environmental turnover, and this effect is more pronounced in tropical than temperate realms (buckley and jetz 2008 ), suggesting that tropical systems may be more susceptible to impacts from climate change. these results

beyond our current set of experiences [21,60]. molecular approaches and genetic engineering will foster better understanding and manipulation of physiological mechanisms responsible for crop growth and development, as well as the breeding of stress-adapted genotypes [61-63], but there are social controversies surrounding the use of some of these technologies. high-throughput phenotyping platforms and comprehensive crop models will lead to more rapid exploration of genetic resources, enabling both gene discovery and better physiological understanding of how crop improvement can increase tolerance to environmental stress [64-68]. development of new crop genotypes to meet the need to thrive under future management and climate conditions, the expected increases in the frequency of climate shocks and the uncertainty of rates of climate change presents a challenge. the specific examples set forth in the following paragraphs demonstrate how greater understanding of biochemical pathways, plant traits and phenotypes and germplasm evaluation could help overcome bottlenecks in both yield and development of physiological resilience to environmental stresses. molecular approaches provide opportunities to establish linkages between biochemical pathways and physiological responses. in cereals such as rice, grain yield is highly dependent on the carbohydrate source (top leaves) and sink (florets) relationship, which is strongly influenced by the plant hormone cytokinin cytokinin production also affects drought tolerance and senescence, and isopentenyl transferase (ipt) expression controls upregulation of pathways for cytokinin degradation. therefore, it follows that tolerance of abiotic stress by delaying stress-induced senescence through manipulation of ipt expression in transgenic lines could maintain optimal levels of cytokinin, resulting in greater fitness and more seed and grain production when exposed to varying drought intensities preand postflowering, transgenic rice with higher ipt expression maintained consistently higher grain yields and concentrations of sucrose and starch compared to the wild-type genotype. the delayed onset of drought-related symptoms in the transgenic lines caused positive source - sink relationships for a relatively longer period with higher photosynthetic rates than the wild type. combinations of

policy. climate prediction for adaptation decision-making scientifi c understandings of phenomena are often tested via predictions that are compared against observations. for example, weather forecasters evaluate the skill of their forecasts by comparing predicted weather against actual weather events. decision-makers also make predictions about the relationship of actions and outcomes when they choose one course of action over another. such predictions involve some expectation of the consequences of action and the desirability of those consequences. lasswell and kaplan 1950 explain: 'decision making is forward looking, formulating alternative courses of action extending into the future, and selecting among alternatives by expectations about how things will turn out.' there is therefore a natural tendency for policy-makers to look to scientists to aid decision making by providing insight on how the future will turn out. in many cases, science has provided enormous benefi ts to decision-makers, either by providing an accurate forecast of future events, such as knowledge of an approaching storm, or by enabling technological innovation that helps decision-makers consciously steer the future toward desired outcomes, such as with the invention of vaccines that improve public health. but there are other circumstances where an improper reliance on scientifi c prediction to enable decision-making does not have such positive outcomes; policy responses to earthquakes are a notable example (see sarewitz and pielke jr, 1999 ). climate science has proven to be enormously valuable in detecting and attributing recent changes in the climate system. science has shown that the climate system is undergoing unprecedented changes that cannot be explained solely

the differences between models. in results shown here, the ozone solar response was also found to be relatively insensitive to period, once the aliasing of the ssts with the solar cycle during the years 1960-1981 was considered. aside from this complication of the correlation between the ssts and the solar cycle, by using the observed ssts instead of climatological values the models might be expected to simulate improved, stronger tropospheric wave forcing which is no longer smoothed as much over time. the brewer-dobson circulation is then more realistic, resulting in an improvement in the simulated sensitivity to the solar cycle of ozone transport. this would imply the need for observed ssts and a fully varying solar phase, as have been incorporated in the model simulations here. support for these arguments comes from additional simulations of models used here austin et al. 2007a; marsh et al. 2007] as well as the many simulations shown by soukharev and hood [2006] in which the lower stratospheric tropical maximum response is not well reproduced with climatological ssts and fixed phase solar forcing. it would be natural to conclude that the correct details of the

simulate this feature using climatological ssts and fixed solar forcing (maximum/ minimum) schmidt and brasseur 2006; t. nagashima, personal communication, 2007]. a pertinent question would be whether

individual wells becomes excessive, could be an important low-cost cornerstone of poverty reduction and climate change adaptation in africa, if paralleled by adequate resource mapping and management (macdonald et al. 2009 the largest threat to the local irrigation economy, however, is neither a diminishing resource base nor imperfect agricultural practices. while farmers try to integrate in the larger economy in order to overcome poverty and to adapt to environmental changes, they become subject to market failures that are partially the result of monopolistic local market channels, but are also in their essence caused by unfair and unpredictable patterns of global trade. this observation is not new, and many development efforts and initiatives for economic growth have been doomed to failure under the prevailing macro-economic conditions of global markets. however, it is the double exposure to global environmental change and economic globalisation, the intensification of trade and the falling of political barriers towards trade (at least in the south) that need to be taken into consideration when local adaptive capacities are discussed. there are already enough convincing

the discussion of the physical processes modeled in studies of land cover change, a general schematic is provided in fig. 2 for the example of conversion from forest to grassland. as discussed in detail below, changes in land cover lead to changes in parameters controlling the use of available water and energy at the surface. in the lad scheme, altered surface parameters include the rooting depth, non-water-stressed (nws) bulk stomatal resistance, surface roughness length, snow-free surface albedo, and snow-masking depth. these model-prescribed parameters are shown in bold in fig. 2, with increases and decreases associated with the parameterization implemented in the gfdl model. values of each of these parameters are listed in table 1 for each of the cover types (see milly and shmakin 2002a for more details). figure 3 maps differences resulting from parameter changes between the all1990 and the natveg simulations. the rooting depth is directly related to the water-holding capacity of the root zone shown in fig. 3, and the snow-masking depth is directly related to the critical snowmass (the snow amount that hides half the surface) listed in table 1. three model-prescribed parameters directly influence the hydrologic cycle through their influence on evapotranspiration e ): the rooting depth, the roughness length, and the non-water-stressed bulk stomatal resistance (top-left side of fig. 2). decreases in the rooting depth effectively reduce the maximum waterholding capacity (the soil moisture reservoir size) of the grid cell. for a given rainfall event, a small soil moisture reservoir is more likely to saturate than a large reservoir, so precipitation is more likely to be removed by surface runoff, leaving less moisture available for evapotranspiration. decreases in the roughness length (grasslands typically are shorter than forests) lead to decreases in turbulent mixing in the boundary layer and decreased evapotranspiration, although the effect is small in the model. changes in the non-water-stressed bulk stomatal resistance (effectively including changes in leaf-scale stomatal resistance and leaf area) influence the ease with which water can pass from the plant to the atmosphere: increased resistance results in less evapotranspiration in the model. for the lad parameter settings used in the gfdl model, changes of any one of these three parameters lead to decreased evapotranspiration in the tropics when forests are converted to grasslands. where midlatitude forests are replaced with grasslands, decreased stomatal resistance increases evapotranspiration, while the roughness length and rooting depth changes reduce evapotranspiration through similar processes as those operating in the tropics. as will be discussed in the next two sections, the net effect of these changes is decreased evapotranspiration in most regions in the gfdl model. other parameters altered in most studies of land cover change impact the surface albedo. in the gfdl model, the relevant parameters are snow-free albedo and snow-masking depth (top right of fig. 2). when forests are converted to grasslands, the snow-free albedo increases and the snow-masking depth decreases. the effect of the former parameter change is to increase the surface albedo year-round in tropical regions and during periods with no snow cover in middle and high latitudes. the effect of the latter parameter change"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the intention of the second test listed in the text above?", "id": 20869, "answers": [{"text":

"policy development the literature on policy development yields two insights for identifying candidate pathdependent processes. first, change and stability in policy choices must be tracked over time (clemens and cook 1999 mayhew 2002 ). baumgartner and jones 1993 have asserted that seemingly stable policies are often ''punctuated,'' moving them to a new equilibrium. the implication is that policy analysts should focus on better understanding when ''windows'' or ''triggers'' cause such punctuations. cashore and howlett 2007 ), drawing on durrant and diehl 1989 ), help identify the policy implications of different approaches to trying to create such punctuations that are relevant to super wicked problems. they conceptualized four types of policy development that differentiate change that is progressive and transformative from change that does not reflect a new punctuated equilibrium. two types of change are in equilibrium: ''faux paradigmatic'' in which what appears to be a significant change only ends up being reversed (often following the election of a new government); and ''classic incremental'' in which small changes oscillate creating limited behavioral change and/or impact on the policy problem. two other processes of policy development head toward a new equilibrium: the ''classic paradigmatic'' in which a single-shot big change occurs that is not reversed; and the much less studied ''progressive incrementalism,'' where policy development is characterized by steps, which can accumulate over days, weeks, months, years, and decades to produce significant results (table 2 ). these distinctions are important to avoid misdiagnosing those short-term, single-shot large changes as transformative that are more likely ''faux paradigmatic'' (such as when major initiatives of one political party are reversed following the election of the opposition party). they also underscore the potential of misdiagnosing progressive incremental processes as single-shot paradigmatic. often antecedent and unexplored progressive incremental forces that create, and lead to, well studied ''tipping points'' are not sufficiently recognized.6this neglect justifies our focus on these potential progressive incremental triggers, and drawing on these lessons, to apply them forward. finally, the time dimension of progressive incrementalism requires careful attention: actors who attempt to trigger such change must assess whether there is a plausible logic that an intervention, or set of interventions, is likely to unleash a path-dependent process that can change behavior before the time runs out to address the super wicked problem in question. the second insight from the policy development literature is that different ''levels'' or ''orders'' of policy characterizing a policy regime--from goals and broad instrument preferences to specific technical settings and calibrations--may change and remain stable according to different causal processes (cashore and howlett 2007 ). to better understand these processes, and to chart the course of policy change, analysts focusing on triggering policy solutions for super wicked problems must recognize and disentangle these different levels and the opportunities they provide. at each level, for instance, the role played by government officials may vary. specific details of policy are often easier for bureaucrats to change than broad policy goals (hall 1993 ). this is because government officials almost always have more discretion in fine-tuning (e.g., changing the speed limit from 60 to 55

must be tempered with knowledge that future large-scale disturbances and extreme weather events are also likely to increase. at the individual project level, management strategies such as manipulation of forest structure, age, and composition can be used to influence carbon sequestration and reversal risk. because some management strategies have the potential to maximize risk or carbon objectives at the expense of the other, policymakers should ensure that forest offset policies and programs do not provide the singular incentive to maximize carbon storage. given the scale and magnitude of potential disturbance events in the future, however, management decisions at the individual project level may be insufficient to adequately address reversal risk; other, non-silvicultural strategies and policy mechanisms may be necessary. we conclude with a brief review of policy mechanisms that have been developed or proposed to help manage or mitigate reversal risk at both individual project

considerably faster than groundwater flow, and is generally rare in humid climates due to less intensive rainfall, well-developed vegetation, and sufficient infiltration capacity of most soils

increases (decreases) as the corresponding variable increases. the coefficient on education is positive and significant for every crop in table 1 except for rice and maize which are not significant. this result implies that lower educated farmers tend to grow fruits and vegetables, the omitted choice. potatoes are more often chosen when the dominant soil at the farm is a lithosol. when the dominant soil is a luvisol, farms tend to choose maize less often, but potatoes more often. wheat, potatoes, and soybeans are more likely to be chosen if a farm has planosol soils. farms with computers are more likely to choose potatoes and rice. it is not clear whether this equipment actually enhances the profitability of these crops or whether the computer is a proxy for a missing

(yield) and independent variables (acreage, rainfall, and temperature). the results in table 1 show that for corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat, the variables are stationary as a panel or integrated order zero (i(0)), rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root. to test the sensitivity of this result to possible violation of the assumption of serially uncorrelated errors, either the error terms can be tested directly, or an additional test can be performed. a slightly modified test is described in im, pesaran, and shin that is robust to serial correlation. since the results we obtain by this second method are the same as for the first, reported in the second section of table 1, we conclude that we do not have serial correlation in the errors of any of the variables. the bottom section of table 1, shows that a different modification of the test, based on demeaned variables in each panel, yields slightly different results. since the de-meaned version of the test 8 is robust to correlation across regions, we conclude that there is correlation across regions. this result is not surprising since we will show the existence of random region effects in the production functions that we estimate in the next section. we proceed by differencing the non-stationary variables, sorghum yield, cotton precipitation, and soybean temperature, in their region panels. these differenced versions are re-tested as panels and are shown to be stationary or i(0). these panel time series characteristics of the data are used in formulating the estimation approach. stationary versions of all of the variables are used in the panel production function model in the next section. this avoids possible spurious correlations between variables and allows the establishment of valid relationships. in addition, a deterministic time trend may be included that does not suffer from an inflated t-statistic. fixed or random effects? having established the time series properties of the variables, it is important to establish the correct panel model form. results of the previous section reveal that some of the variables in table 1 have correlations across regions. to test for fixed or random region effects in the model, several approaches are available. the breusch and pagan test considers a null hypothesis that the variance of region and time specific effects is zero, in a two-way error component model. honda suggests a one-sided version of this test, which is preferred because of expected non-negative variance components. honda's version of the test is a uniformly most

wave is confirmed as the silent killer of mute victims, unveiling social inequalities in the face of risks (klinenberg, 2002). we have seen that several definitions of heat wave exist among the international community of meteorologists. some rely upon absolute temperature thresholds for day and night temperatures, while others consider relative excess above past averages. duration is another factor. however, based upon the french experience, heat waves may be seen as an event that brings the dangers of climate into the here and now (in contrast to future and uncertain concerns, and to other distant parts of the world, i.e., less developed countries). among those dangers, direct fatalities are foremost, but a large span of impacts must be considered. further research could bear on heat wave as a systemic risk (e.g., oecd, 2003) as clearly it qualifies for this description: complex, characterized by open system boundaries, second-order uncertainty, and controversy. the administrative and political division of europe into different countries is swept aside in the case of heat wave: high temperatures easily jump formal borders and victims are to be found in many

potassium. in dry areas, the soils have low organic matter mainly because rainfall is low, variable, unreliable and poorly distributed. to understand the distribution of soil in kenya, the country can be divided into three broad regions: humid, sub-humid and arid. the humid regions (highlands) are areas with an altitude of over 1500m which receive an annual rainfall of over 1000 mm, and include the highlands east and west of the rift valley and the rift valley floor. they have volcanic rocks and the soils are mainly loamy. other humid areas with an altitude less than 1500m (humid lowlands) have sandy soils which are well drained and are of loamy, sandy clay texture (e.g. along the kenyan coast). other areas of the highlands have fertile loam soils, while alluvial soils (silts) are found along river valleys. sand dunes and mangrove swamps are found along the coast. the soils covered by mangrove swamps are deep, grey, saline and poorly drained. the sub-humid regions (the lake region and western kenya) receive slightly less rainfall than the humid areas. they have volcanic and basement rocks and soils are red clay and generally productive. these regions lie between 1000m and 2000m above sea level and rainfall is up to 1000 mm per year. dark red clays, sandy loams and alluvial deposits of eroded material from the uplands are common along the flood plains of big rivers in these

disaggregation of the daily values into hourly values whilst conserving the generated daily totals/averages (i.e. it is micro-canonical). a major part of this procedure uses the diurnal cycle arising from the predictable sequence of incoming solar radiation, with consequent effects on sunshine hours, temperature etc. the hourly model follows the same methodology as the daily model, interpolating (for each half month) the necessary ivrs (at the hourly/daily scale) to the 5 km grid from values determined from hourly station data. because of the difficulties associated with assembling long

mid-latitude forest, because of the limited size of the labile soil carbon pool. we also show that warming increases the availability of mineral nitrogen to plants. because plant growth in many mid-latitude forests is nitrogen-limited, warming has the potential to indirectly stimulate enough carbon storage in plants to at least compensate for the carbon losses from soils. our results challenge assumptions made in some climate models that lead to projections of large long-term releases of soil carbon in response to warming of forest ecosystems. the acceleration of global warming due to terrestrial carbon-cycle feedbacks may be an important component of future climate change 1 ). recent experiments with fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate models suggest that carbon-cycle feedbacks could substantially accelerate 2 or slow 3 climate change over the 21st century. both the sign and magnitude of these feedbacks in the real earth system are still highly uncertain because of gaps in basic understanding of terrestrial ecosystem processes 2 3 ). for example, the potential switch of the terrestrial biosphere from its current role as a carbon sink 4 5 to

defining what constitutes \"dangerous\" climate change,4 a strong international consensus has emerged that says that preventing a rise in global temperatures of more than two degrees celsius above pre-industrial revolution levels is critical (corresponding to a level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of approximately 450 parts per million). beyond this level, feedback loops in the climate system become increasingly likely-- and the threat of relatively rapid and catastrophic changes becomes significantly greater. unfortunately, the increasing attention paid to mitigating dangerous climate change has not prevented a continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions. in fact, emissions are increasing more rapidly than even the worst case scenario modeled by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), and predictions about the likely effects of anthropogenic influence on the climate have become increasingly severe.5 the global population continues to rise (particularly in emerging economies such as china and india), along with the per-capita emissions of many millions of people. it remains to be seen whether global temperatures will exceed the twodegrees limit. but some anthropogenic climate change has already occurred (global temperatures have risen by around 0.74 degrees celsius in the last 100 years) and because of the inertia in the climate system, a further warming of approximately 0.6 degrees celsius is inevitable.6 thus, the window for effectively mitigating against a twodegree rise in global temperatures is extremely narrow, and many prominent members of the climate science community have begun to question whether preventing a rise in global temperatures of this magnitude (or even greater) is possible using existing mitigation approaches.7 scientists and policymakers are increasingly asking what will happen if the two-degrees \"guardrail\" is breached, particularly if temperature increases in excess of two degrees lead to positive feedback loops and further accelerate climate change. are existing mitigation and adaptation policies enough to prevent catastrophic changes in the climate from occurring? in

exist within india (mcmanus 2000 1). in addition, the historical and per-capita focus of the newspapers' coverage portrays a situation where illegitimate and legitimate emissions exist, differentiated by their country of origin and divided along global north-south lines, actually justifying rising emissions in india. in one journalist's words, india feels like it should be 'allowed [its] turn at the party'. at both the international and sub-national scales, then, the coverage of climate change by the english-language press in india re-frames the climate change debate around a nationalistic argument of 'us' versus 'them', at the expense of other key issues in the debate. 6.1 the role of the media in climate change in india the coverage of climate change by the english-language press highlighted in this paper is clearly related to the readership of these newspapers in india. as publications written in english, these four newspapers automatically target and reach a readership that is restricted to the upper sections of society. because of the vertical social stratification that continues to exist in india, the english-language dailies serve only this one elite layer, communicating climate change in a manner that responds to the private sphere whose values and concerns they up-scale (sonwalkar 2002 ). the freelance writers interviewed suggested that like in any mass media 'each publication caters to its audience', and so in the case of the english-language press in india the 'media essentially reflects elite perceptions'. according to one reporter, this means that the papers 'pick climate change up, play with it when [the elite] want them to, or not when they don't want to'. by creating a discourse of international 'carbon colonialism', the papers simultaneously articulate a 'nationalistic narrative' that presents india as socially homogenous while 'backgrounding' the increasing emissions of the industrial elite within the country (fernandes 2000 2; plumwood 2003 in adams and mulligan 2003 56). the national circulation of these newspapers, unique to them within the indian media, reinforces this focus on a national frame. spatially, the

physical and social learning environments, school climate, classroom climate, interactions and relations, teachers' role and strategies, participation and exclusion, or organisation and values in educational settings. of these 25 programs, there are only four programs (1.3%) that seems to have--when reading their short description--their main focus on the psychosocial aspects of educational settings, or classroom climate, in primary and secondary education, and for which organisational or didactic issues, subject-related motives, or the physical environment are not the main issues. considering the tendencies that seem corroborated by these analyses, it could be relevant to attempt to understand the reasons underlying this neglect of social climate issues occurring in the educational field. this disregard appears quite strange if we consider its recognised value emerging from research. aim and method the aim of this article is to analyse the reasons underlying the present sparse attention devoted to the concept of classroom climate, or the social climate of learning environments, in the fields of educational research and teacher education, in spite of the evidence from several fields of research that testifies to the importance of classroom climate for students' well-being and outcomes and education quality. the learning environment is a context for students' learning processes, but can be placed in a broader context, if we consider its interplay with other external factors in an integrated systems framework. for instance, moos 1991 suggested that a relevant task for the study of learning environments is investigation of the complex connections between school, work and family settings. the aim of this study is similar, in the sense that it also looks at the interplay of factors at various levels in the educational system. one difference is that the object of this analysis is not the social climate of learning environments as an observable phenomenon, but rather the concept of social climate itself. the aim is to describe how conceptions of social climate (e.g. beliefs about or attitudes towards social climate in educational

closer examination of gender roles in the climate change debate. a great part of developing countries does not meet the above requirements. this is the case, in particular, of the least developed

asia (where are the remaining ldcs), represent the most vulnerable regions to the adverse effects of climate change. this vulnerability is strictly correlated to the low adaptive capacity of the populations, which in turn, linked to the extreme poverty and inequality that affects many of them. integrated approaches and the support of the international community will play a key role in reducing their vulnerability and thus facing adverse effects of climate change. if adaptation issues are \"essentially about who will bear the cost of coping with climate change to the extent that it occurs\"24 on their side, mitigation issues are about preventing or limiting the occurrence of climate change. mitigation focuses on tackling the very cause of climate change: the increase of ghgs by either reducing these emissions at source or by increasing sequestration of these gases by sinks or reservoirs. mitigation, in fact, considers primarily interventions acting on the root cause of the problem, that is to say the increase in ghgs emissions. options for tackling them include both their reductions at source as well as increasing their sequestration through sinks. examples of mitigation activities include the strengthening of energy efficiency of power plants, the correction of the current patterns of energy production and consumption and both the enhancement and the

care for family members, which limit their mobility and increase their vulnerability to natural disasters and other local sudden climate changes. eff orts to keep the adverse eff ects of climate change to a minimum should ensure that policies address issues of women's empowerment. individual assets that bring benefi ts to a woman's family and community, such as health and education, are easily attainable with good reproductive health. in particular, adequate birth spacing improves maternal and infant health and resilience, and contributes signifi cantly to women's ability to be economically productive. gender diff erences must be taken into account not just in terms of diff erential vulnerability but also as diff erential adaptive capacity. during a natural disaster, for example, women have a key role in protecting, managing, and recovering lost household resources, and often develop innovative strategies to address climate change.120 case studies in senegal, bangladesh, and ghana showed grassroots women's groups developing strategies to cope with issues related to energy and forestry, agriculture, water resources, and trade. women should be perceived as

realistic barotropic model climate. this barotropic model climate has reasonable approximations of the arctic oscillation (ao) and pacific/north america (pna) teleconnections as its two leading principal patterns of low-frequency variability. the systematic strategy consists first of the identification of slowly evolving climate modes and faster evolving non-climate modes by use of an empirical orthogonal function (eof) decomposition. the low-order stochastic climate model predicts the evolution of these climate modes a priori without any regression fitting of the resolved modes. the systematic stochastic mode reduction strategy determines all correction terms and noises with minimal regression fitting of the variances and correlation times of the unresolved modes. these correction terms and noises account for the neglected interactions between the resolved climate modes and the unresolved non-climate modes. low-order stochastic models with only 4 resolved modes capture the statistics of the original barotropic model modes quite well. a detailed budget analysis establishes that the low-order stochastic models containing the principal two teleconnection patterns are dominated by linear dynamics and additive noise. the linear correction terms and the additive noise stem from the linear coupling between resolved and unresolved modes, and not from nonlinearities as assumed in previous studies."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is deeply contested area?", "id": 6707, "answers": [{"text": "climate science is a deeply contested area", "answer_start":

contribution to climate change is set to grow as global demand for animal products rises. even with ambitious action to reduce the emissions intensity of livestock production, it is unlikely that global temperature rises can be kept below two degrees celsius in the absence of a radical shift in meat and dairy consumption. addressing livestock demand is also a highly cost-effective mitigation strategy as it affords more of the global carbon budget to other sectors where emissions reductions may be harder to achieve. lower consumption of livestock products in high-consuming countries could also yield significant environmental and societal co-benefits for health, global food security, water security and biodiversity. despite the clear case for action to tackle demand for meat and dairy products, there is a remarkable lack of policies, initiatives or campaigns to do so. the received wisdom among governments and campaign groups appears to be that trying to reduce consumption of animal products is at best too complex a challenge, and at worst risks backlash. however, this view remains untested and ignores the fact that government interventions and public campaigns in pursuit of societal benefits have successfully shifted consumer behaviour in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of smoking. the lack of attention afforded to the issue by governments and environmental groups contributes to a significant lack of understanding about the links between livestock and climate change among publics - an awareness gap. this is a problem in itself, as the multinational survey undertaken for this study indicates that low awareness translates to a lack of willingness to change behaviour in order to reduce emissions. relative to other sectors, the awareness gap for livestock is particularly large. it also appears to be particularly inhibiting of change: for livestock, unawareness is significantly more likely to be associated with unwillingness to change behaviour than is the case for other sectors. closing the awareness gap is likely to be a precondition for voluntary behaviour change to reduce individual emissions, and for societal responsiveness to government interventions or public campaigns to encourage behaviour change. the survey found that consumers with a higher level of understanding of the links between livestock production and climate change are more likely to indicate willingness to reduce their meat and dairy consumption. the survey also revealed that those actors most trusted to inform consumers on the links between livestock and climate change are generally 'experts' and environmental groups, though there are important differences between countries and consequently communication strategies to close the awareness gap should be tailored to national contexts. however, the challenge is more complex than simply closing the awareness gap. strategies must be designed to enable willing consumers to change their behaviour. but consumers tend to prioritize factors with an immediate and direct personal impact such as taste, price, health and food safety. indirect societal concerns such as climate change tend to be secondary. this implies that strategies should avoid compromising primary motivating factors (for example, consumers may be reluctant to compromise on taste or enjoyment of food in order to reduce their emissions). strategies may be more likely to succeed if they include, or are complementary to, other primary motivating factors (for example, consumers may be more willing to reduce their individual contribution to climate change by reducing meat and dairy consumption if they can also realize health and livestock - climate change's forgotten sector"}, {"qas": [{"question":

decentralised decision-making systems within organisations that have a role in determining the resilience of systems. in contrast, many adaptation projects and policies may be formulated with an assumption that they will progress logically, in a linear fashion. this may be led by a technologically driven approach, but also because systems of project funding, management, monitoring and evaluation take a more linear approach and do not incentivise strategies for dealing with the high degree of uncertainty that exists in socio-ecological systems. some of the other characteristics discussed in this review offer some insight on how to accept and engage with uncertainty, including flexibility, redundancy and effective institutional structures. while this strain of analysis has contributed to a proliferation of debates on the development of systems that engage and accept change, there remains a need to translate this idea that originated in the ecological sciences into settings with complex social dimensions (cannon and mueller-mahn 2010). even though experiments in adaptive policy making, adaptive management and adaptive governance of socio-ecological systems are all working towards this end, this remains an emerging field of knowledge. 2.4 non-equilibrium system dynamics a non-equilibrium approach argues that restoring equilibrium may return a system to a state where it is vulnerable to the impact of the same perturbation again. holling (1973: 2) engaged with this characteristic in his analysis of the resilience of ecosystems, arguing that, '...an equilibrium centred view is essentially static and provides little insight into the transient behaviour of systems that are not near the equilibrium. natural, undisturbed systems are likely to be continually in a transient state'. while inherently linked to accepting 'uncertainty and change' (section 2.3), this characteristic adds another element. this demonstrates that rather than working towards making systems return to stable states after a disturbance, there needs to be a recognition that there are sets of relationships amongst a number of different system elements and each is organised around individual equilibriums (ibid). a disturbance may change the position of these components within a system, but the system will persist as long as the relationships between these components remain similar (ibid). this persistence of relationships then becomes a measure of the system's resilience. folke (2006: 253) also refers to this characteristic when he writes, 'old dominant perspectives have implicitly assumed a stable and infinitely resilient environment where resource flows could be controlled and nature would self-repair into equilibrium... the resilience perspective shifts policies from those that aspire to control change in systems assumed to be stable, to managing the capacity of socialecological systems to cope with, adapt to, and shape change.' similarly, an analysis of resilience in a part of the dutch coast constructed a picture of a similarly, an analysis of resilience in a part of the dutch coast constructed a picture of a coast that is ...continuously changing, so no original or equilibrium state can be identified. moreover, perturbations are not isolated events from which a coastal system may or may not recover, but are ever-present and occur at different temporal and spatial scales, (klein et. al 2003: 39) despite the dynamic nature of the adaptation issue, summarised as the problem of hitting a moving and uncertain target, adaptation projects often fail to acknowledge the dynamism that"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the aim of the paper?", "id": 10236, "answers": [{"text": "our aim in this paper is to report

catastrophic failure. the information in the public domain is enough to illustrate the scale of the issue. 23 the reservoirs act 1975 applies to all reservoirs holding or capable of holding more than 25 000 cubic metres of water. there are over 2500 such reservoirs in the uk, of which 530 are large enough to be included in the world register of large dams. owners of dams covered by the act are obliged by law to have them inspected every 10 years by a civil engineer from a special panel, but the law does not specify the details of the inspection or that the results should be published. in practice, the thoroughness of the inspection depends almost entirely on how much the dam owner is prepared to pay, and the author is not aware of any case where the results have been published, or even given to local authority emergency planning officers or the emergency services. at the time of writing, dam owners in england and wales also refuse to issue dam break flood inundation maps. this could mean, and indeed this has happened, that planning officers for the local authority might grant planning permission for new housing developments within the area that would be flooded if the dam failed, simply because they did not know that the area was within the danger zone. dam owners in scotland are obliged to make such maps available to emergency planners, fire and rescue services and the police, so that evacuation plans can be made. by contrast, in france, everyone living in areas at risk from dam break is fully aware of the fact, and these areas are subject to frequent evacuation exercises. informal comments from engineers would seem to indicate that they believe the british are more likely than the french to panic if they were given such information. climate change could well lead to an increased risk of failure of british dams, some of which are as much as 300 years old. failure can be caused by many factors, for example climate change, could lead to subsidence of the dam foundations, landslip into the reservoir or overtopping due to heavy rainfall. around half of the 2500 large uk dams have earth embankments, most of them constructed before heavy soil compaction equipment was available. little is known about the content of such embankments, especially the core, or the extent of internal settlement or disturbance, for example from rabbit burrows. droughts could lead to cracking of the embankment wall, and climate change will lead to more droughts in the summer, followed by more rain in the autumn. this could impose additional loads, which were not considered when the reservoir was planned. there could also be additional loadings from increased snowfall in upland areas, followed by rapid snowmelt due to rainfall. higher windspeeds over the reservoir surface could cause more frequent overtopping, leading to erosion of earth embankments unless suitably protected. other possible causes of failure include vandalism of valves, pipe work or controls, terrorism or aircraft crashes. many dams are in or near urban areas, for example there is a large reservoir in brent in london which is very close to housing and aircraft flight paths. most uk dams are over 100 years old. a detailed record is kept of defects in dams but this is not published. the reasons for the secrecy surrounding the condition of the nation's dams is not clear, but prudent insurance underwriters are always inclined to assume the worst when information is withheld. the record of dam safety in the uk has been excellent since 1925, but climate change fears might cause some underwriters to reassess the situation. it would seem quite likely that there are people living and working within the danger zone of large dams in the uk. in the usa, where information is more readily available, more than 2000 communities have been identified as being at risk from dams that are believed to be unsafe. more free ebooks http://fast-file.blogspot.com"}, {"qas":

the kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent reduction by 2008-12. just adding back in aviation and overseas activities of uk residents puts a dent in this performance--emissions have fallen only 11.9 per cent. even this adjustment puts the uk's meeting of the kyoto target in jeopardy. but taking all greenhouse gases embedded in imports and subtracting greenhouse gases embedded in exports, helm et al

increasing) their carbon consumption (probably significantly), and developing countries are unlikely to agree that the industrialized countries' responsibilities are exhausted by addressing their

food insecurity in the future. we consider the ways in which people deal with climate variability and extremes and how they may adapt in the future. key knowledge and data gaps are highlighted. these include the timing and interactions of different climatic stresses on plant growth and development, particularly at higher temperatures, and the impacts on crops, livestock and farming systems of changes in climate variability and extreme events on pest-weed-disease complexes. we highlight the need to reframe research questions in such a way that they can provide decision makers throughout the food system with actionable answers, and the need for investment in climate and environmental monitoring. improved understanding of the full range of impacts of climate change on biological and food systems is a critical step in being able to address effectively"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the factors that revealed in the first GCM study?", "id": 9295, "answers": [{"text": "the first gcm

accrue interest only works as an argument against zero discounting and reduced mitigation efforts in the present under assumptions of high substitutability. assumptions about substitutability are pivotal in understandings of the 'problem' and can have distributive justice implications across and within generations. in reality, some goods are substitutable and impacts can be cushioned through financial or technological transfers, while other impacts on endangered species, cultural systems,5 ecosystems and landscapes are not. stabilization levels will have significant distributive justice impacts, as those dependent on nonsubstitutable resources will bear a greater share of costs under higher stabilization. within climate policy, assumptions about substitutability are partially reflected in the mechanisms used to limit emissions. as first discussed in weitzman (1974), price mechanisms cap economic impacts while reducing emissions. quantity controls limit emissions but do not limit economic impacts, and reflect an assumption of lower substitutability. which instrument to prefer depends on the rate (and uncertainty) at which economic and environmental impacts change with

any sophisticated device or packing medium for biomass attachment and retention. the process was initially developed for the treatment of concentrated wastewater, with very good results. however, similarly to the expanded bed process, in warm-climate regions, uasb reactors have also been applied for the treatment of low-concentration wastewater (domestic sewage) with very good results. as a consequence, uasb reactors are currently one of the preferred alternatives for sewage treatment in these regions. more details about the design and operation of uasb reactors are given in chapter 27. (d) expanded granular sludge bed anaerobic reactor theexpandedgranularsludgebed(egsb)anaerobicreactor(figure26.15)greatly resembles the uasb reactor, except in respect to the sludge type and the expansion degree of the sludge bed. mainly granular-type sludge is retained in the egsb reactor and is maintained expanded because of the high hydraulic rates applied to the system. this condition intensifies the hydraulic mixing in the reactor and makes a better biomass-substrate contact. the high surface velocities of the liquid in the reactor (in the order of 5 to 10 m/hour) are achieved through the application of a high effluent recirculation rate, combined with the use of reactors with a high height/diameter ratio, around 20 or more (kato, 1994; lettinga, 1995). in contrast, in the uasb reactors, the sludge bed remains somewhat static, since the surface velocities of the liquid are usually lower, in the order of 0.5 to 1.5 m/hour. regarding the applicability of egsb reactors, these are mainly intended for the treatment of soluble effluents, as the high surface velocities of the liquid inside 724 anaerobic reactors"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where are areas of concern

with elaborate social and land tenure arrangements that contribute to the management of resources and reinforce societal resilience in the face of change. in its discussion on the impacts of climate change on rural livelihoods, the ipcc's fourth assessment report (ar4) concluded that the topic required further development, noting that 'a number of case studies of impacts on smallholder livelihood systems in developing countries are beginning to appear'. in an analysis of over 350 case studies of indigenous peoples' adaptation in domains such as agriculture, water management, coastal management, disaster response and health, galloway mclean (2010) concluded that the most common adaptation responses by indigenous peoples involved adjustments required to adapt livelihoods to changing climatic conditions. the ar4 urged caution, however, in the analysis of livelihood impacts. specific impacts (such as those due to climate change) must be examined within the context of whole sets of confounding impacts at regional to local scales (adger, 2003; eakin, 2006; leichenko and o'brien, 2008). it is difficult to ascribe levels of confidence to these confounding impacts because livelihood systems are typically complex and involve a number of crop and livestock species, between which there are interactions, for example, intercropping practices (richards, 1986) or the use of draught-animal power for cultivation (powell et al., 1998), and potential substitutions such as alternative crops (ipcc, 2007). in their discussion on climate change impacts on remote pacific island communities in the solomon islands, rasmussen et al. (2009) remark that it is methodologically complex to distinguish adaptive actions and strategies directly related to climate change from general livelihood strategies, which also take into account climatic variability and the risks of extreme weather events. indeed diversification of livelihoods is a strategy shared by many indigenous peoples to enhance resilience in a context of environmental uncertainty. kronik and verner (2010a) consider multi-activity or diversification to be a central adaptive strategy, based on the acquisition of diverse livelihood skills (e.g. fishing, farming, hunting and gathering) and supplemented with new techniques adopted from other peoples, indigenous and non-indigenous. this"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Is assisted colonization included in assisted gene

environmental governance. the institutions range from systems of generating, assessing and disseminating scientific information to national reporting instruments and mechanisms for capacity building and financial aid. where they are based on legal commitments and universal application, such institutions not only support the objectives of specific environmental treaties but become an important feature of overall environmental governance. they foster learning effects among states, with regard to the understanding of global environmental problems and the choice of effective policy instruments (haas et al., 1993; vogler, 2005). third the firm commitments that states enter into as part of a legally binding global deal send strong signals to private actors in the global economy, enabling them to reduce transaction costs. in contrast to voluntary pledges in a highly fragmented global governance system, a comprehensive treaty-based regime increases the credibility of public undertakings to reduce pollution. this in turn can stimulate a more determined effort by the private sector to deal proactively with environmental problems early on. such signalling is particularly important for long-term investment decisions by the corporate sector in environmentally friendly technologies and processes (engau and hoffmann, 2009). fourth even if international agreement on a global deal remains elusive, the continuous push for such an outcome helps to maintain political momentum in international negotiations. environmental leaders routinely put ambitious targets and time frames on the international agenda to set a high level of expectations and mobilise support for international solutions. the very fact of an ongoing negotiation process creates its own dynamics and can contribute to a more collaborative spirit among participants. as depledge and yamin (2009, p. 439) point out, '[t]he negotiating environment of a regime enmeshes delegations in a dense web of meetings, practices, processes, and rules, generating an inherent motivation among negotiators to advance the issue'. this logic of institutional bargaining is evident in the two-decade-long history of climate negotiations. at various points, negotiators were able to renew momentum for an international climate deal despite setbacks such as the us withdrawal from the kyoto protocol in 2001. in some sense, therefore, copenhagen can be seen to represent just another hold-up on the long road towards the final goal, a comprehensive international treaty on climate mitigation and adaptation. but as we argue in this article, the copenhagen conference revealed not only the lack of willingness among key actors to commit to a legally binding climate treaty; it also demonstrated that the 'global deal' strategy may have passed the point of diminishing returns. how has it come to this? from kyoto to copenhagen: a road to nowhere? the kyoto protocol epitomises both the success of the global deal strategy and its shortcomings. on the one hand, it was the first climate agreement that laid down quantitative targets for emission reductions. these are to be achieved over the first commitment period of 2008-12, by which time a new and more comprehensive treaty is meant to succeed kyoto. the kyoto protocol introduced innovative instruments for achieving its overall target in a costeffective manner, such as the flexibility of a five-year commitment period based on a mixed basket of six greenhouse gases, emissions trading, the clean development mechanism and joint implementation. the kyoto protocol thus scores highly in terms of some of its political achievements. the very fact that it was adopted in the face of strong resistance from powerful states and influential business interests is in itself a sign of the success of the 'global deal' strategy. on the other hand, in order for the kyoto protocol to be adopted, a number of compromises had to be built into the agreement that severely curtailed its environmental effectiveness (helm, 2009; victor, 2001). first, kyoto exempted all developing countries from mandatory emission reduction targets. this, of course, reflected the unfccc's principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities'. but by creating a sharp dividing line between annex i countries and nonannex i countries, the question of how to include the rapidly emerging emitters from the developing world in future mitigation efforts was left unresolved. it was to resurface as a critical stumbling block in the run-up to the 2009 copenhagen conference. second, and related to the first point, the united states never ratified the protocol, not least due to the us senate's insistence that emerging economies also undertake mandatory emission reductions. america's 2001 denunciation of its signature of the protocol dealt it a critical, if not fatal, blow. it removed the then largest greenhouse gas emitter from the regime's core mitigation effort, thus reducing its environmental impact even further; it placed an even heavier political and economic burden on the other industrialised countries that sought to make the agreement work without us participation; and it cast a shadow over any future effort to negotiate a post-kyoto climate treaty. re-engaging the us thus became an imperative for reviving the global deal strategy. third, the kyoto protocol suffered from several shortcomings in its regime design, including the short-term nature of its emission targets, the ability of countries to withdraw from the agreement and a weak compliance mechanism. these design faults reduced the incentives of annex i countries to invest in mitigation efforts and undermined the willingness of non-annex i countries to join the agreement at some future point. as barrett (2003,"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Explain the criticisms of Deepak Kiawali from Nepal?", "id": 251, "answers": [{"text": "deepak gyawali, from nepal,

impact these species and reduce cti scores.160therefore, clavero et al.160suggest that land use change needs to be controlled for in assessing the effects of climate change on community composition; e.g., by stratifying analyses by land use change. these examples illustrate the difficulty in attributing changes in biodiversity to either land use change or climate change. analyses need to be appropriately designed with adequate spatiotemporal data on both drivers. for example, a recent study by eglington and pearce-higgins31compares the relative impact of climate change (temperature and rainfall) versus land use change (degree of agricultural intensification) on bird populations. results suggest that land use change has been a more significant driver of bird declines compared with climate change to date. although, their model did not consider interaction effects between climate and land use, these could potentially be included in the analytical framework. finally, where empirical analysis is not feasible (e.g., due to spatial extent of a study) then processbased theoretical modeling may play a useful role in exploring land use change climate change interactions

"in both studies, the potential responses to climate change impacts described are primarily dictated by sectoral stakeholders. in london, lccp (2006a) also draws upon comparative analysis that identifies adaptive measures used in cities that currently experience similar climate conditions (now) to those projected for london under future climate change scenarios. however, the uncertainty that resides in impact analysis, from, for example, the range of conditions under alternative climate change scenarios, has so far deterred sectoral adaptation analysis away from probabilistic scenario-based quantification and towards the pursuit of adaptation strategies that utilise options that will be beneficial even in the absence of climate change. for example, city of london, (2006), categorises all identified adaptation options as being no-regret, (benefits outweigh costs under all climate scenarios), 33 low-regret, (low costs and potentially high benefits), win-win (address climate risks and also result in other benefits), or flexible (in responding to uncertainty under longer term climate change). the resulting options are then evaluated qualitatively. as an illustration, in order to manage flood risks a suggestion is that \"the city of london corporation should consider installing sustainable drainage systems, green roofs or green walls on city of london corporation-owned car parks and buildings when they are refurbished or replaced\". this example also serves to illustrate that a key feature of the research on adaptation is to identify the principal actors likely to be engaged in implementation of specific adaptation actions. this example also serves to illustrate the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation decisionmaking into current investment cycles. this process has been further formalised in the analysis of the water resource sector in new york, (rosenzweig et. al. 2007). here, the stepped assessment procedure for adaptation outlined in table 3 has been developed in a context where a mature infrastructure system exists, where its managers are skilled at dealing with existing hydrologic variability, and where there are many potential adaptations to the risk of climate change in the nyc water supply, sewer, and wastewater treatment systems. quantitative modelling of existing hydrologic variability, quantitative analysis of climate change impacts - imposed on projected socio-economic change - has subsequently been developed. whilst quantitative decision analysis has not been reported to date, it is understood that appraisal of new infrastructure will use cost-benefit studies to estimate net benefits and reduce fiduciary risk. thus, investment appraisal in e.g. transport (london) and water supply (new york) appear to be principal areas where quantitative analysis will be undertaken. it is notable, however, that quantitative analysis on an aggregated, multi-sectoral, basis, as utilised by integrated assessment models at macroscales, is not undertaken at the city-scale in these examples, suggesting that there remains the potential for such indicators to be used in a more strategic way within city administrations and beyond. finally, as highlighted earlier, some city-based sectoral impacts such as water and food supplies have to be viewed within a broader geographical context, london and new york, need to be seen as global 34 mega-cities with substantial economic importance both nationally and internationally, having assets and operations at risk from projected climate change. since both cities are major global financial market centres they can also be viewed as competitors with each other. indeed, the london scoping study makes this competitiveness explicit by sketching out an index of attractiveness. it then attempts to evaluate how climate change impacts may affect its competitiveness vis-a-vis new york and tokyo. interestingly, it concludes that on this type of index these cities may suffer more in relative terms than london."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what does the climate system contains?", "id": 6488, "answers": [{"text": "the climate system contains several types of

certain climate thresholds, for example, those that may trigger thc collapse ++ and the occurrence of one or more extreme or unprecedented weather/climatic events. the latter, for example, is explicitly discussed as a form of abrupt climate change in the nrc report. an unprecedented event occurring in a given place is abrupt in the sense that the probability of its occurrence suddenly changes from zero to some non-zero value. this may have enormous significance for society. in principle, both of these types of abrupt climate change related to severity are embedded in the ipcc

discuss how society may or may not cope with abrupt climate change, it is also useful to distinguish between the experience of abrupt climate change and the anticipation of abrupt climate change. by focusing on the experience of abrupt climate change, we can use historical examples, or analogues, to explore how societies and ecosystems have responded in the past. the anticipation of abrupt climate change, on the other hand, will lead to a different exploration of climate- society interactions and therefore different forms of adaptive behaviour. table 1 gives an example for each type of

problem in northeast europe because it appears that the parasite is now able to mature to the adult stage in humans whereas previously it had not usually done so. the public health problem is often not suffi ciently appreciated but the epidemiology in europe is complex. there is evidence that infections of d. repens decreased in some areas, for example in italy during the past 20-30 years, but that d. repens is spreading throughout many other european countries and that animal and human infections, in some cases very severe, are increasing. in addition, infections of dirofi laria immitis are dramatically increasing and extending to previously unaffected areas such as switzerland. the changes in disease incidence are attributed to effects of temperature on the parasite itself, on the density of the vector population (and the emergence of ae. albopictus as a competent vector) and to changes in human exposure. recent research demonstrates that temperature dictates the development of dirofi laria larvae in the vector, with a threshold below which development will not proceed and consequently determines the seasonal occurrence of heartworm transmission in temperate latitudes. modelling studies predicting the potential for transmission to humans map the seasonal duration of risk across europe and indicate that areas formerly free of the infection are now endemic14. tackling the issues requires, again, better co-ordination between public health and veterinary health authorities, particularly to advise on the value of preventing infection in companion animals15. plague epizootics human plague, caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis has endemic foci in africa (for example, madagascar, the democratic republic of congo and tanzania), asia and america. since the beginning of the 1990s, the disease has reappeared in various countries where no cases were reported for decades. some of these countries (for example, jordan, algeria, libya) are close to europe. the threat of the re-emergence of plague foci on the european continent is unclear. more than 200 species of rodents can act as reservoirs of plague, and more than 80 species of fl eas may be vectors of the disease. climate defi nitely plays a role in the annual seasonality of plague. the potential effects of temperature rise and drought (or abundant rains) associated with climate change on fl ea survival and reproduction and on rodent prevalence are likely to be complex. although changes in the current geographical plague foci have to be expected, these changes may have opposite effects (a decrease or extension of current foci, an extinction or emergence of the disease in new areas) depending on local environmental conditions. therefore, how climate change will affect plague foci

information from such genotype screens in order to properly investigate the extent of genotypic adaptation to high temperature stress associated with climate change within current crop germplasm. equally, the potential for crop adaptation to climate change through breeding for improved tolerance to high temperatures can be explored in a robust manner within this modelling framework. the relative importance of mean and extremes of temperature varies geographically, and depends upon the genotypic parameters (section 4 ). the impact on yield of changes in duration resulting from seasonal mean temperature changes can have a greater magnitude than that of high temperature stress fig. 9 and its effects can be more widespread fig. 3 ). where the optimal temperature for development is exceeded the resulting increase in duration can mitigate and even counteract the negative impacts of reproductive temperature threshold exceedance on yield, provided that there is sufficient water for the crop to benefit from the extended duration. the magnitude and sign of this effect depends on the degree of tolerance of the crop to temperature extremes; hence yields are particularly threatened when water availability and/or mean temperature shorten the duration of a crop which experiences and is sensitive to high temperatures during flowering. the degree of sensitivity determines the response of not only mean yields, but also the magnitude of interannual variability fig. 9 ). increases in maximum temperature between the two time periods studied are associated with increases in the diurnal temperature range and hence in vpd (section 3.2 ). due to the high temperatures involved, the regions where this occurs will tend to be co-located with regions where reproductive temperature thresholds are being exceeded. hence, as well as the impact of mean temperatures on the rate of development, which are linear for t topt, there is a non-linear response to diurnal temperature amplitude, of the kind described by porter and semenov (2005) 6. conclusions methods like those employed here can be used to quantify the impact of high temperature threshold exceedance on crops. the results from this study suggest that temperature extremes could be an important determinant of the yield of annual crops, specifically in parts of northern and southern india.

observed data used for the rainfall-runoff modelling. no change in the daily variability of the rainfall is assumed compared with that of the baseline series. this is the simplest method, widely applied in impact studies. the second method changed the number of wet days in each month, as well as changing the monthly totals--the 'change in rain days' method. the increase in the monthly total during the winter (october to march) was modelled as an increase of the number of wet days in which every third dry day was made wet (figure 3c). the percentage increase was divided equally between the 'new' wet days, giving typically between one and five extra wet days during each winter month. proportional changes were applied to wet summer days when an increase was predicted. for a decrease in summer monthly totals, the change was initially applied proportionally and then any day with less than 2 mm of rainfall was deemed to be dry. the total rainfall removed by reducing the number of wet days was then redistributed amongst the remaining wet days to maintain the correct monthly total. this method essentially created wetter winters with more wet days and drier summers with more dry days. such a change is typical of milder winters, with westerly type airflow with a succession of frontal systems, and of warmer and drier summers, punctuated by more intense, short-duration convective storms. the third method, termed 'enhanced storm', sought to change the intensity of daily rainfall while maintaining the average monthly changes as prescribed by the gcm. this method held the number of wet days constant but added the percentage increase in rainfall equally onto those days with the three highest recorded totals, creating an enhanced storm profile (figure 3d), thereby

value chains), on livestock and fi sheries production systems, on pests and diseases, and on food security dimensions other than production. despite uncertainty involved in climate impact studies and limitations to climate and crop models, it is clear that climate impacts on food security will be serious, and thus we advocate for more research that directly informs the actions needed to tackle food security challenges. while food systems will need transformative options in the coming decades, we identify four immediate challenges. the fi rst is to change the culture of research to focus on outcomes. this will involve extensive stakeholder engagement. the second is to design and trial portfolios of options. solutions will be highly context-speci fi c, so we need a focus on prioritization approaches for the bene fi t of communities, projects and countries. again stakeholder engagement is central to success. the third challenge is to achieve social inclusion through a focus on people who are most vulnerable to climate change. the fi nal challenge is to address adaptation and mitigation together in the context of food security, at farm, national and global levels. to meet these challenges, science must work hand in hand with practitioners and policy-makers, to devise sensible options that meet current needs and capacities, try out best bets, and learn from experience.

apparent that mitigation could not prevent climate change from occurring; temperatures would continue to rise even if stabilization of carbon dioxide were achieved.(8)these factors led to recognition among the international climate change community that adaptation was a necessary complement to mitigation for reducing vulnerability to climate change. this shift in attitude is reflected in the changing titles of the three ipcc working group ii assessment reports completed between 1990 and 2001 (table 1), as well as in a number of recent reports on approaches to impacts and adaptation

buildings and cities. pv systems provide clean electricity while producing no co 2 it is estimated that for every kilowatt hour (kwh) of pv electricity that is produced 0.6 kg of co 2 is saved, with this figure rising to 1 kg/kwh when the pv replaces off-grid diesel. in ordinary uk houses, for instance, it has been shown to be possible to reduce co 2 emissions by up to 60% with energy efficiency measures, but using pvs, solar hot water and passive solar systems, 90% reductions in emissions can be achieved, enough, in the view of the royal commission on environmental pollution, to stabilize climate change, 36 if such reductions were achieved across the buildings board. pv energy supply is located at the point of demand so there are few or no losses incurred in transporting the electricity, and therefore enhancing security in the supply. pvs can supply electricity to locations remote from a traditional grid. the pv electricity supply can be isolated from the grid supply and so provide a reliable back-up at periods of grid failure. this factor is already important because over 3 billion people today are connected to conventional electricity supply systems and pvs offer the opportunity for them to have such back-ups when the power fails, although the connection mechanisms are not well developed to achieve this yet. thus solar energy will become increasingly important as conventional grid supplies become less reliable. in many parts of the world brownouts (reductions in voltage that dim the lights) and blackouts already occur at the times of day when power is most needed. an example of this is in hot countries when the surge of demand on hot summer afternoons means that blackouts shut down air conditioning systems. in sensible low-energy buildings cooling may be achieved with pv-powered ceiling fans or passive cooling, so making buildings, in many climates, comfortable again. although pv systems cannot run large air conditioning systems, great advances have been made in the field of solar cooling. solar systems are quiet, robust and require little maintenance or repair. they often form part of the building skin itself, so reducing the cost of

instance, apis mellifera sahariensis is found in the oases of the sahara, where it has adapted to local bloom (such as palm flowers) and extreme heat (33). in the usa, honey bees can develop in the arizona desert. the survival requirement for these bees is a supply of water, which they use in large quantities to raise their larvae and to regulate the brood temperature to between 34degc and 35degc. in an arid environment, desert flowers are unable to provide the bees with enough water and they die. according to climate change predictions, desert regions will become even drier, leading to the disappearance of oases and their honey bees. apis mellifera sahariensis is highly unlikely to migrate naturally to more favourable desert areas because oases are very isolated and not conducive to long-distance migration or swarming. it is therefore vital to envisage conservation measures to transfer this bee to zones favourable to its development, lest we lose this ecotype that is so valuable for world biodiversity. climate change can influence the honey bee development cycle. it is generally agreed that each race of honey bees develops at its own rate (21). any sort of climate change or movement of a race of honey bees from one geographical region to an alien one is therefore bound to have measurable consequences. in cool regions, honey bees spend the winter clustered in a tight ball and use their honey stores to provide them with the energy they need to survive until spring. the honey bee's capacity to accumulate energy reserves and to manage the colony's development exerts significant adaptive pressure. in the spring, when the weather becomes more clement, the queen starts to lay eggs and the colony develops and increases the size of the worker population. a cold snap lasting several weeks may occur during which the honey bees are unable to harvest. the large size of the honey bee population causes such a rapid depletion of stores that the colony can die of starvation. it is something that can easily happen to hybrid bees (crosses of several races by bee breeders), which develop very fast in spring. in contrast, local ecotypes that are better adapted to the environmental conditions are more cautious and develop more slowly in spring until after this cold snap, when they breed very rapidly. in this way they avoid jeopardising the colony's survival. a distinction therefore needs to be made between local ecotypes, which need to adjust their development and stores to the climate, and hybrid bees selected by bee breeders. hybrids have not been bred to build up food stores, the queen does not adjust her egg-laying and the workers do not adjust their larvae-rearing, with the result that the bees are unable to survive without the assistance of a beekeeper to provide them with unlimited supplies of sugar solution (21). the variability of the honey bee's lifehistory traits as regards temperature and the environment shows such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise to the selection of development cycles suited to new climatic conditions. bees adjust their behaviour to weather conditions. they do not go out when it rains and, in extremely hot weather, they gather water to keep the colony cool."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is recognised as a threat to the achivement of the MDGs", "id": 18485, "answers":

greater susceptibility to disease and/or parasites, and altered ecosystem function. these changes could eliminate species from all or part of their present ranges(8, 9)and would affect sustainable harvests of fish. evidence suggests that, in some regions, fisheries may already be experiencing the effects of climate change. for example, climate change has been identified as a potential contributor to declining salmon stocks on the pacific coast.(10)in the arctic, reports of sockeye and pink salmon captured well outside their known range may be related to recent warming

greenhouse gas emissions are even more problematic to transfer than climate-friendly technologies; not only does it build on particular csas, but such knowledge is often also of a tacit nature and organizationally embedded. this is most clearly seen in emissions trading. currently, an fsa in emissions trading will be difficult to transfer to other affiliates within an mne, due to the international fragmentation of support for the kyoto protocol. a global framework for emissions trading has not been established yet, but remains restricted to regional initiatives. the eu-ets is the most prominent example and an fsa based on trading in this scheme is constrained to this region as it has not been linked to other schemes yet (cell 3). what is more, even though when new trading schemes are established, mnes can build on their learning experience with the eu-ets, this experience may be of limited value. it typically involves tacit, market-specific knowledge such as rules for allocating and trading allowances, which tend to differ considerably, even within the eu (boemare quirion, 2002) and is by and large organizationally embedded. being able to successfully trade emission allowances often depends on good communication between trading and production departments; an organizational capability that cannot be transferred easily. for these reasons, such organizational capabilities cannot be replicated but need to be recombined instead to fit local conditions (helfat peteraf, 2003). when recombining is perceived as too cumbersome, however, mnes may

confused 'realised fitness' (or relative reproductive success) with that expected on the basis of design. this is a crucial point when attempting to decide whether a given trait is an adaptation. george c. williams highlighted the importance of design considerations in evolutionary theory and noted that 'evolutionary adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should not be used unnecessarily, and an effect (a fitness-increasing use to which a trait is put) should not be called a function (a designed fitnessincreasing use) unless it is clearly produced by design and not by chance'. thus, when claiming that a trait is an adaptation, it must be at least the relatively best engineering solution to a problem bearing on the survival of the organism, and have been produced by natural selection (i.e. by preferential survival of organisms expressing the trait). this rigorous use of the term 'adaptation' contrasts with the common practice to assume that any distinctive feature of an organism that is associated with a reproductive advantage for its bearers (i.e. realised fitness) is an adaptation in an engineering sense. the term 'exaptation' was coined by gould and vrba in 1982 to account for situations in which a trait enhances fitness in a given environment but has not evolved through the action of natural selection in that environment. a trait might thus have evolved, for example, in response to aridity or nutrient-impoverished soils, and then confer survival value in a subsequent fire-prone environment. to distinguish between adaptation and exaptation, the following four criteria were proposed by brent d. mishler that must be satisfied before any trait can be accepted as an adaptation: (i) engineering design: the structure must function in the hypothesised way. requires a functional test. (ii) heritability: differences between organisms must be passed on to the offspring, at least probabilistically. requires heritability tests (e.g. parent - offspring correlations and common garden studies). (iii) natural selection: differences in fitness must occur because of differences in possession of the hypothesised adaptation in a common environment. requires fitness tests.

hydrological (water) cycle. hydrological extreme events are typically defined as floods and droughts floods are associated with extremes in rainfall (from tropical storms, thunderstorms, orographic rainfall, widespread extratropical cyclones, etc.), while drought is associated with a lack of precipitation and often extreme high temperatures that contribute to drying. floods are often fairly local and develop on short timescales, while droughts are extensive and develop over months or years. both can be mitigated: floods by good drainage systems and drought by irrigation, for instance. nonetheless, daily newspaper headlines of floods and droughts reflect the critical importance of the water cycle, in particular, precipitation, in human affairs. flood damage estimates are in the billions of us dollars annually, with thousands of lives lost, while drought costs are of similar magnitude and often lead to devastating wildfires and heat waves. an example is the extreme drought in california in 2007 that set the stage for the costly extensive wildfires in october 2007, with over 2000 houses burned and about 1 million people displaced. the loss of life and property from extreme hydrological events has therefore caused society to focus on the causes and predictability of these events. tropical cyclones typically have the highest property damage loss of any extreme event, and

mainly related to the concentration and activity of the present biomass, and also to the mixing and flow regime in the reactor, considering that all environmental factors (temperature, ph, alkalinity, etc.) are within the optimum range. the most common objectives to be achieved in the operation of high-rate anaerobic processes are the control of the solids retention time (independently from the hydraulic detention time), the prevention against the accumulation of inert suspended solids in the reactor and the development of favourable conditions for mass transfer. these objectives are generally achieved when the reactors are well designed and constructed, and when appropriate procedures during the start-up and operation of the system are taken. (a) grease removal the same considerations made in the previous section for anaerobic filters, regarding the importance of the installation of grease removal units preceding anaerobic reactors, are valid for the uasb reactors. the operational problems resulting from the non-removal (or inadequate removal) of grease can be highly detrimental, as these materials may enable the excessive accumulation of scum inside the gas collectors, hindering the release of gases and demanding special devices for its periodical removal. 794 anaerobic reactors although the installation of a grease removal unit upstream uasb reactors is not a regular practice yet, the operational problems that have occurred in units already installed have called the designers' attention towards the inclusion of this unit in the design of new treatment plants. (b) removal of coarse solids as highlighted in the beginning of this chapter and in chapter 27, the effective removalofcoarsesolidsbeforethesewageisdirectedtotheuasbreactorsisessential. in the particular case of the uasb reactors, the operational problems resulting from the non-removal (or inadequate removal) of coarse solids may jeopardise the whole operation of the treatment system, once these materials can adversely affect the distribution of the influent wastewater at the bottom of the reactor, and generate and accumulate a sludge with poor characteristics, with low activity and difficult to remove. the concern with the excessive entry of larger dimension solids in the uasb reactors is so great that many of the new designs have considered the installation of sieves, with openings from 1 to 5 mm, to reduce at the most the operational problems resulting from the entry of solids into the reactor. (c) considerations and criteria for the start-up of the system volume of seed sludge the volume of seed sludge for the start-up of the system is usually established as a function of the initial biological loading rate applied to the treatment system. the biological loading rate (kgcod/kgvs * d) is the parameter that characterises the organic load applied to the system in relation to the amount of biomass present in the reactor (see chapter 27, equation 27.14). the biological load values to be applied during the start-up depend essentially on the type of seed sludge employed and on its acclimatisation to the wastewater to be treated. it is recommended that whenever possible, the biological load for the start-up be established by means of specific methanogenic activity tests of the sludge (see chapter 25). should it be impossible to perform these tests, biological loads in the range from 0.10 to 0.50 kgcod/kgvs * d, relating to specific methanogenic activities between 0.10 and 0.50 kgcod-ch4/kgvs * d, are used during the startup of the process. these initial loads should be gradually increased according to the efficiency of the system and the improved activity of the biomass. volumetric hydraulic load the volumetric hydraulic load is equal to the amount (volume) of sewage applied daily to the reactor per unit volume (see chapter 27, equation 27.8). the hydraulic load produces at least three different effects on the biomass of the reactor during the start-up of the system:"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Is it plausible to financial resources?", "id": 7461,

flushing models were either based solely on forcing temperatures (1-phase models) or both on chilling and forcing temperatures (2-phases models). leaf senescence models were based on both autumn temperature and photoperiod. we show that most flushing models are able to predict accurately the observed flushing dates. the 1-phase models (based on forcing temperatures) are as efficient as 2-phases models (based both on forcing and chilling temperatures) for most species suggesting that chilling temperatures are currently sufficient to fully release bud dormancy. however, our predictions for the 21st century highlight that chilling temperature could be insufficient for some species at low altitude. overall, flushing is expected to advance in the next decades but this trend substantially differed between species (from 0 to 2.4 days per decade). the prediction of leaf senescence appears more challenging, as the proposed models work properly for only two out of four deciduous species, for which senescence is expected to be delayed in the future (from 1.4 to 2.3 days per decade). these trends to earlier spring leafing and later autumn senescence are likely to

climate models for long-term water management and adaptation planning? or put another way: as hydrologists, what features would we like to see represented well in regional climate simulations? these questions are exercising both scientific and policy-making communities as the prospect of unavoidable climate change grows with each failed attempt to set international targets for greenhouse gas emissions. they also expose a more profound conceptual divide between those advocating a scenario-led approach to adaptation, and those who have concluded that scenarios are better used for sensitivity testing and adaptation options appraisal (wilby dessai, 2010). this note addresses both applications of climate models: first, by offering criteria that may help evaluate climate model skill from a water management perspective; second, by closing with remarks about the utility of scenario-led approaches for adaptation in practice. hydrological processes operate across at least nine orders of magnitude in both space and time (bloschl sivapalan, 1995). attendant management scales are equally diverse: spanning minutes for realtime flood protection through to multiple decades for water provision. therefore, it is unlikely that any single review of climate model outputs will be sufficiently broad to cover all scales of hydrological interest. we should also keep in mind that the original intent of coupled ocean/atmosphere general circulation models (oa/gcms) was to assess the global consequences of different emission pathways and, only relatively recently, how we might adapt at regional and local scales (schiermeier, 2007). downscaling techniques are one manifestation of wider efforts to bridge these discordant scales under the general mantra of climate risk information at the scale required for decision making (see for example, fowler et al. 2007). with the above points in mind, five principles are recommended for those selecting climate models for hydrological applications: 1. quantify the uncertainty in the observed data used for model evaluation in any comparison study there should always be healthy scepticism about the quality and homogeneity of the observed data used to gauge model performance. it is well known that incremental or step changes in meteorological records can arise from changes in site, instrumentation, observing or recording practices, site characteristics, or sampling regime (kundzewicz robson, 2004). observing networks may be spatially biased towards lower-elevation, urban or coastal locations. discharge records may be influenced by non-climatic factors including changes in land cover and management, urbanization, river regulation, water ion and effluent returns, or flood-flows by-passing gauging structures. trends found in shorter series may cease to be significant when the influence of outliers (at the start or the end of the record), or multi-decadal variability have been taken into account. ideally, confidence intervals should be provided for all observations to reflect the timeand space-varying density, completeness and homogeneity of data used for benchmarking models. 2. compare like with like

other words the variables age and smoking are causes (parents) of the effect (child) lungcancer. furthermore, let us say that for the considered population the age of a person does not significantly impact whether he/she smokes or not. thus age and smoking are considered independent of each other, and the intuitive causal graph shown on the left of fig. 2a does not show an edge between them. the graph in fig. 2a contains a v structure at lungcancer since this node has two parents that are not connected to each other. the name v structure comes from the fact that these three nodes form the shape of a ''v'' if we follow the convention of placing parents higher up on the page than children. the v structures leave a distinct footprint that can be detected in the corresponding data and thus can be used to determine directions in a directed graph representation. namely, the parent nodes are independent of each other, but they become conditionally dependent if the state of the child is known. let us illustrate this conditional dependency using the lung cancer example. we made the assumption that age is independent of smoking, that is, knowing the age of a person does not tell me anything about his/her smoking habits. however, if we know the status of the variable lungcancer, say that a person has been diagnosed with lung cancer, then the parent nodes become dependent. for example, knowing that a person with lung cancer diagnosis is of a young age raises the probability that the person is smoking because lung cancer patients often have at least one of the two major risk factors, increased age or smoking. for undirected graphs, v structures also play a special role. an undirected graph is unable to represent the independence relationships of a v structure, resulting in an additional edge between the parents. figure 2b shows the correlation graph for this example. figure 2c shows the undirected and fig. 2d the directed graph that would be obtained through structure learning. because of the v structure, learning yields only one directed independence graph in the lung cancer example (fig. 2d), and this graph perfectly matches the original graph (fig. 2a). in contrast three different directed independence graphs were obtained for the match example in fig. 1d because of the lack of a v structure in that application. because of the v structure, the undirected independence graph contains one more edge than the directed independence graph, namely between the parent nodes age and smoking. while in this particular example the correlation graph has

of exposure to climate risks even within particular sectors. for instance, rain-fed agriculture projects might be much more vulnerable than projects in areas with reliable irrigation. at the same time, the irrigation systems themselves may also be at risk, further complicating the picture. similarly, most education projects would hardly be affected by climatic circumstances, but school buildings in flood-prone might well be at risk. without an in-depth examination of risks to individual projects, it is impossible to capture such differences. hence, the sectoral classification only provides a rough first sense about the share of development activities that might be affected by climate risks. to capture some of the uncertainty inherent in the sectoral classification, the share of development activities affected by climate change was calculated in two ways, a rather broad selection, and a more restrictive one. the first selection includes projects dealing with infectious diseases, water supply and sanitation, transport infrastructure, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, renewable energy and hydropower15, tourism, urban and rural development, environmental protection, food security, and emergency assistance.16 the second classification is more restricted. first of all, it excludes projects related to transport and storage. in many countries, these projects make up a relatively large share of the development portfolio, simply due to the large size of individual investments (contrary to investments in softer sectors such as environment, education and health). at the same time, infrastructure projects are usually designed on the basis of detailed engineering studies, which should include attention at least to current climate risks to the project.17 moreover, the second selection excludes food aid and emergency assistance projects. except for disaster mitigation components (generally a very minor portion of emergency aid), these activities are generally responsive and planned at short notice. the treatment of risks is thus very different from well-planned projects intended to have long-term development benefits. together, the first and the second selection give an indication of the range of the share of climate-affected development activities."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Describe the preferred policies for managing coastal areas?", "id": 21036,

environmental change in the greater himalayas affects much of inland china, central and south asia, and the mainland of southeast asia. the himalayan region is the most critical region in the world in which melting glaciers will have a negative affect on water supplies in the next few decades (barnett et al. 2005). moreover, the impacts of climate change are superimposed on a variety of other environmental and social stresses, many of them already recognised as severe (ives and messerli 1989), causing uncertainty (thompson and warburton 1985), and leading to contradictory perceptions (ives 2004). the himalayas straddle some of the world's poorest regions and the plains below them are densely populated. within these populations and communities, the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed, either in intensity within the region, or among different sectors of society. the more fragile the ecosystem and the poorer and more marginalised the people, the earlier and greater the impact. this is inevitable unless concerted and effective action is taken to engage them and assist them to cope with the changes. mountains are part of the coupled ocean-atmosphere and terrestrial systems. continuing climate change is predicted to lead to major changes in the strength and timing of the asian monsoon, inner asian high pressure systems, and winter westerlies, the main systems affecting the climate of the himalayan region. the impacts on river fl ows, natural hazards, and the ecosystem, as well as on people and their livelihoods, can be dramatic, although not the same in rate, intensity, or direction in all parts of the region. given the current state of knowledge, determining the diversity of impacts is a challenge to researchers and risk assessment is needed to guide future actions."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the key assumption?", "id": 15469, "answers": [{"text": "our key assumption is that the climate variables in a given nonlinear system

this assumption, we have developed an explicit and rigorous mathematical strategy for such an approach that is implicit in much of the work in stochastic climate modeling in the literature [1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25]. the closed nonlinear stochastic equations are derived for the climate variables alone on longer time scales in a rigorous fashion that accounts for strong coupling between the climate variables and the unresolved variables. furthermore, the predicted stochastic evolution equations for the climate variables are given quantitatively so the theory is effectively computable but much simpler than turbulence closure. these equations display several potentially important new phenomena not included in the previous applied efforts in climate modeling. these phenomena include systematic nonlinear corrections to the climate dynamics due to the interaction with the unresolved variables and the appearance of multiplicative stochastic noises besides additive noises for the climate variables. we also showed that stochastic equations for climate variables alone can be both linearly stable or unstable, and we gave explicit mathematical criteria and examples with unstable linear langevin equations for the climate variables. such examples with less stable stochastic models for the climate variables on a longer time scale indicate that interactions with the unresolved variables can diminish predictability under appropriate circumstances. throughout this paper we have used as an illustrative example the idealized climate model of a barotropic flow on a beta plane with topography and mean flow introduced by leith these are especially attractive climate models because they are highly inhomogeneous yet involve both a well-defined mean climate state as well as energy spectrum. in spherical geometry such models capture a number of large-scale features of the atmosphere we have demonstrated the feasibility of our general strategy for this idealized climate model. we have also shown that the idealized climate model of a barotropic flow can be made fully consistent with equilibrium statistical theory by appropriate constraints on the parameters in the stochastic model. furthermore, we have demonstrated that the stochastic model for the climate variables alone that is derived from the barotropic flow equations also satisfies an equilibrium statistical theory. simpler examples illustrating the appearance of new phenomena were also given, whereas the general stochastic model equations for the climate variables alone that are derived from

perceptions of climate change tally with records from weather monitoring stations is somewhat equivocal. in many cases available climate records are shorter than the memories of the farmers themselves. among adaptations made in response to climate change, planting different varieties of the same crop and changing dates of planting are important everywhere. but stratifying the data by the precise perception of climate change (for example increased precipitation, decreased precipitation, changes in the timing of the rains, etc.) provides greater insights. when temperatures change farmers plant different varieties, move from farming to non-farming activities, practice increased water conservation and use shading and sheltering techniques. for changes in precipitation and particularly in the timing of the rains, varying the planting date appears to be an important response. there is also evidence that adaptation measures are linked to baseline climate and that adaptation occurs mainly on those sites that are already marginal in the sense of being hot and dry. there are important differences in the propensity of farmers living in different locations to adapt and there may be institutional impediments to adaptation in certain countries. although large numbers of farmers perceive no barriers to adaptation those that do perceive them tend to cite their poverty and inability to borrow. few if any farmers mentioned lack of appropriate seed, security of tenure and market accessibility as problems. those farmers who perceive climate change but fail to respond may require particular incentives or assistance to do what is ultimately in their own best interests. adaptation to climate change actually involves a two-stage process: first perceiving that climate change has occurred and then deciding whether or not to adopt a particular measure. this gives rise to a sample selectivity problem since only those individuals who perceive climate change will adapt, whereas we wish to make statements about the population of agriculturalists in general. 2 using heckman's sample selectivity probit model, econometric investigation reveals that although experienced farmers are more likely to perceive climate change, it is educated farmers who are more likely to respond by making at least one adaptation. farmers who have enjoyed free extension advice and who are situated close to the market where they sell their produce are also more likely to adapt to climate change. land tenure has little if any impact on the propensity of farmers to adapt. in terms of policy implications it appears that improved farmer education would do most to hasten adaptation. the provision of free extension advice may also play a role in promoting adaptation. in so far as distance to the selling market is a significant determinant of whether a farmer adapts to climate change, it may be that improved transport links would improve adaptation although the precise mechanism underlying this is unclear. better roads may allow farmers to move from subsistence farming to cash crops, or facilitate the exchange of ideas through more regular trips to the market. there are many country specific differences in the propensity of farmers to adapt and further analysis would be required to understand the underlying factors. adaptation, however, is something undertaken only by those who perceive climate change. the perception of climate change appears to hinge on farmer experience and the availability of free extension advice specifically related to climate change. but while the policy options for promoting an increased awareness of climate change are more limited the perception of climate change is already high."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the requirement

sectoral climate-related vulnerabilities, and the cognitive, social, and institutional contexts within which these will be managed, in light of the deep uncertainties associated with climate change

currently there is a severe underutilization of climate models as tools to support decision making. this underutilization stems from a double challenge noted by a growing number of scholars: a widespread, but limiting, conception that the potential usefulness of climate models in planning begins and ends with everfiner regional-scale predictions of multidecadal climate change; and the general failure so far to incorporate learning from the decision and social sciences into climate-related decision support in key sectors such as water resources, coastal protection, agriculture, and

among offspring is partitioned into variation due to fathers ('sires' in the quantitative genetics literature), variation due to mothers ('dams'), variation due to the interaction between maternal and

the sire component of variation in any offspring trait is viewed as additive genetic variation in that trait. diallel designs have been used in a range of systems to great effect, but their use is particularly suited to the study of marine organisms, because many are broadcast spawners that shed both eggs and sperm externally. this is ideal for diallel breeding designs because ejaculates of sperm and clutches of eggs can be repeatedly subdivided and crossed together such that the sperm of each male can be crossed with the eggs of many different females at the same time (and vice versa

regions should be neglected by conservation efforts, but rather that climate change may significantly limit efforts directed at retaining specific species in these regions. it is important to note that our estimates of faunal change are all reported as percentages of the number of species currently at a site. due to latitudinal trends in species richness, the largest changes in the absolute

"organisms are expected to balance energy allocation in such a way that fitness is maximized. while much research has focussed on allocation strategies of reproducing parents, in particular birds, relatively little attention has been paid to how nestlings allocate energy while in the nest. nestling birds are faced with a tradeoff between devoting energy to growth or to thermoregulation, and in altricial species it is likely that the thermal environment of the nest site influences the nature of this trade-off. here, we experimentally investigate how altering the microclimate of nests affects the growth, size and survival, as well as cell-mediated immune (cmi) response, of nestling tree swallows tachycineta bicolor in a temperate environment. we place air-activated heating pads in nests of swallows when young were between 4 days and 16 days of age, and compared performance of offspring to control nests. our manipulation raised temperatures of heated nests by approximately 5  c compared to control nests. offspring in heated nests had enhanced survival while in the nest, and we also found that they were heavier and had longer ninth primary feathers at 16 days of age. in addition, heating nest boxes resulted in significantly faster growth of primaries, and there was a trend for growth rates of mass to also be higher in heated nests. there were no significant differences between heated and control nests in growth rate or size of tarsus at age 16 days, and we speculate that this lack of response to elevated nest temperatures may be due to growth of skeletal structures being limited by other factors such as calcium availability. we also found no difference between heated and control nests in cmi response. nonetheless, our results show overall that increasing temperatures of nests has significant benefits that enhance the fitness of offspring. as provisioning rates to offspring did not differ between heated and control nests, we suspect that the beneficial effects of heating were not the consequence of changes in parental behaviour. our results provide insight into factors, other than food supply, that have important consequences in determining reproductive success of birds breeding in temperate environments. keywords reproductive success ae tachycineta bicolor ae temperature ae trade-offs ae tree swallows"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is runoff?",

organization-centered and centrally managed protest space, while #cop15 reflected a more decentralized crowdsourced scheme. what is remarkable is that both stayed fairly consistently on topic and displayed little violent disagreement. as already indicated, #thewave hashtag was launched and largely managed by the sccc coalition coordinating the march. the sccc and its supporter organizations used several digital technologies in a strategy of personalizing the mobilization around the march, enabling users to fill in details in the protest narrative and to customize their digital interactions with the coalition. the sccc initiated several twitter storm campaigns before and during the protest. one storm on november 5, 2009, highlighted the official launch of the wave website. the organizers encouraged followers to \"tell all your friends and retweet, retweet, retweet! see you on #thewave.\" (stop climate chaos coalition, 2009b). the hashtag trended to second place among all twitter streams in the united kingdom during the march (twirus uk). after the march, the sccc no longer actively encouraged use of the hashtag, and use died out within days. the sccc strategy of personalizing their public communication meant running the risk of losing control over their message and brand (bennett segerberg, 2011; gillan, pickerill, webster, 2008). yet, #thewave is a

of the projection methodology on human capital dynamics lends parsimony to the approach, for many applications such a simplification may appear too far-fetched. this is particularly the case if trend

change should be able to expand the range of applications of this income projection tool. the model put forward lends itself to applications beyond climate change research and provides a basis for further scenario-building exercises. the simplicity and flexibility of the specification used makes the method particularly attractive to assess research questions related to the macroeconomic

been woefully inadequate in that they have dealt exclusively with political evaluations of possible technical vulnerabilities. your news feature gives an up-to-date depiction of the scientific reality behind the lopsided policy deliberations. we would like to add some points. first is the issue of political motivation. if genetically engineered bioweapons were developed, would they be deployed by nation-states, terrorists or criminals? the problem is that as things stand there are more than enough non-engineered biological agents available to satisfy all these categories. second, technical expertise is far too often overlooked. even if a state or non-state actor has the wherewithal to manufacture an engineered bioweapon -- which entails extensive technical expertise and a huge budget -- there remains the severe problem of adequate dispersal necessary for mass casualties. bioweapons cannot be spoonfed to the intended targets. delivery is an exceptionally difficult science, as has been found in state programmes (for example in the united states, the soviet union and iraq) to create bioweapons. finally, in any assessment it is important not to fall into the anthropocentric trap. the dangers of bioweapons directed at livestock and crops are as great as, if not greater than, those designed against people. the conclusion of your news feature, that whatever advances are made on the offensive side will have beneficial spin-offs on the defensive side, is important. despite the overwhelmingly positive influence on society of the biomedical revolution, especially in genomics and

involved in studying trends in losses, the authors of the ipcc report did not exclude a role for climate change. in particular, one key uncertainty identified has been the incomplete consideration of economic vulnerability to natural hazards, defined as the propensity to incur losses in a hazardous event. focussing on the role of vulnerability in determining today ' s and future disaster loss risk, we critically review the literature on loss trends and projections, and provide context by way of a modeling case study of observed and projected losses from riverine flooding in bangladesh. we

documented evidence regarding decreases in vulnerability in many regions. one such region is south asia, and of particular interest to us is bangladesh, a country heavily at-risk, but also with

include calculated surface air temperatures. as these reanalyses are based on a fixed model, they avoid the heterogeneity of operational weather analyses which are based on models that evolve as numerical weather prediction develops. also, the use of a model yields the benefit of dynamical self-consistency. however, reanalyses have so far proved largely unsuitable for the estimation of long-term climate trends because the input data have time-varying biases, and because changes in data coverage modulate the influence of innate model biases on the analyses. nonetheless, kalnay and cai53 used the ncep/ncar reanalysis to estimate urban and land use related warming over the continental united states. their analysis was restricted to sites at less than 500 m above sea level to

temperatures, provided adequate water is available. temperature optima differ between species and growth conditions, and are higher in elevated atmospheric co2. with increasing temperature, vapour pressure deficits of the air may increase, with a concomitant increase in the transpiration rate from plant canopies. however, if stomata close in response to increasing co2 concentration, or if there is a reduction in the diurnal temperature range, then transpiration rates may even decrease. soil organic matter decomposition rates are likely to be stimulated by higher temperatures, so that nutrients can be more readily mineralised and made available to plants. this is likely to increase photosynthetic carbon gain in nutrient-limited systems. all the factors listed above interact

seasonality and general characteristics of the storms within each cluster. marked intercluster differences in storm intensity and longevity, and the proportion and destructiveness of landfalling storms were identified. in addition to basinwide variability, north atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes exhibit clear intrabasin differences in frequency and track variability when objectively separated and grouped by clusters. for example, proportions of cluster members exhibit decadal shifts in addition to interannual variability, and these shifts often alternate in sign between clusters. the transition to the present regime of proportionally more tropical and fewer baroclinic systems appears to have begun in the early to mid-1980s, 10 years or more before the very active 1995 atlantic hurricane season signaled the end of a multidecadal period of quiescence. additionally, in the period 1950-2007 the steepest positive storm frequency trends are found within the more tropical systems, which comprise more than 70% of the major hurricanes and overall power dissipation, while gulf of mexico storms, which comprise more than 40% of the total number of landfalling storms, exhibit no

should be guaranteed through the placement of a sufficient number of inlet pipes multiple inlets ). only small ponds should have a single inlet. larger ponds should have two, three, or more inlets, distant 50 m at the most one from the other (see figure 20.3). the inlet should not be located in front of the outlet of the pond, even if at long distances, as this facilitates the occurrence of hydraulic short circuits. another approach (mara et al, 1992) suggests, for simplicity, single inlets and outlets in each pond, located diagonally in opposite ends. the argument is that in the case of multiple inlet and outlet structures there may be differential settlements in the structures, altering the relative distribution of the flows (fig. 20.4). should a hydraulic regime approaching that of complete mix be desired in the pond, the inlet pipes should extend to 1/4 to 1/3 of the length of the pond (figure 20.3). should an approximation to a plug-flow reactor be desired, the inlet pipes should discharge closer to the inlet side it is worth reminding that, for construction of stabilisation ponds 629 primary ponds, plug-flow conditions should be avoided as they can cause organic overload close to the inlet end. however, for single-cell maturation ponds, the plug-flow system is thoroughly more advantageous, and no overloading problems at the inlet end are expected. the inlet tubing should be designed for an average flow velocity equal to or higher than 0.5 m s (silva, 1993). in deeper ponds, dead zones are more likely to occur. in these ponds, the design of the inlets and outlets should be made very carefully. in anaerobic ponds, there are indications that a homogeneous distribution at the bottom by means of perforated laterals can contribute to a larger contact between the wastewater and the biomass, thus increasing the efficiency of the pond. figure 20.5 presents some types of inlet devices commonly used by designers (jord~ao and pess^oa, 1995). inlets right at the bottom may suffer blocking problems due to localised silting, in case grit removal is inefficient or the wastewater collection system receives large portions of stormwater, which may include substantial loads of sand. by-pass tubing should be included, allowing the start-up of the facultative pond prior to the anaerobic pond, the interruption in the feeding to a certain pond

events. the term \"abrupt\" often refers to time scales faster than the typical time scale of the responsible forcing (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007a). climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007a). climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (for example, by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and (or) the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007a). climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, and so forth) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007a). operations is used in this report to refer generally to water resources operations. the term \"reservoir regulation\" is used to clarify operations related to dams and reservoirs. the term \"gate operations\" is used specifically to reference the opening and closing of dam or reservoir gates. sea-level change is an increase or decrease in the mean level of the ocean. sea level can change globally because of changes in the shape of the ocean basins, changes in the total mass of water, and changes in water density. sea-level changes induced by changes in water density are called \"steric.\" density changes induced by temperature changes only are called \"thermosteric,\" while density changes induced by salinity changes are called \"halosteric\" (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007b). eustatic sea-level change is a change in the global average sea level brought about by an increase in the volume of the world ocean. relative sea-level rise occurs where there is a local increase in the level of the ocean relative to the land, which might be due to ocean rise and (or) land subsidence. in areas subject to rapid land uplift, the relative sea level can fall (intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2007b). stationarity is the idea that while climate may exhibit variability, the underlying statistics that describe the climate (such as its mean and variance) do not change over time. rather, these characteristics are stationary. this leads to an assumption that the past represents a reasonable proxy for the future. water resource managers have traditionally relied on this assumption by using historical records of streamflow and weather variation to design and operate water resource systems. however, the assumption of stationarity is challenged by climate change, as well as by other changes to hydrologic systems, such as alterations of land use.

excellent (e.g.haworth, 1980) to poor (e.g.ryves et al. 2006). in the case studies here diatoms were well preserved at all sites where they were analysed, providing not only an integrated record of

existing preventive and adaptive coping strategies in terms of their impact on flood damage costs. our results confirm the positive relationship between environmental risk, poverty and vulnerability. poorer segments of society live closer to the river, therefore face a higher risk of flooding and are thus more vulnerable, and we were able to show that actual inundation levels are indeed significantly higher for poorer households. at the same time, environmental risk exposure also goes hand in hand with income inequality and access to natural resources: the higher the exposure level, the higher the inequality and the less access a household has to land. inequality also results in higher flood damage, confirming the hypothesis found in the literature that an unequal income distribution contributes to socio-economic vulnerability. however, the relationship between poverty and damage costs (and hence vulnerability) appears to be more complex than the literature suggests. the poor suffer more in relative terms, but not in absolute terms. average damage costs in absolute terms are significantly higher for wealthier households. moreover, their coping capacity is as expected also greater than poorer households, reflected by the fact that the relative proportion of the flood damage costs in total household income is significantly lower for wealthier families. farmers and fish cultivators suffer most damage, both in absolute and relative terms. approximately one third of their annual household income is lost due to flooding. roy brouwer et al. 19 floodplain households that fully depend on natural resources for their livelihood (the poorer segments in society) suffer significantly less damage, but from our analysis we conclude that this does not exclude income diversification as an effective flood coping strategy. on the contrary, more income sources appear to result in lower average damage costs, suggesting that spreading the environmental risk across multiple economic activities pays off. however, we find that income diversification is primarily a strategy followed by wealthier families and communities living further away from the river. families living nearer to the river seem to have fewer opportunities to engage in multiple economic activities, which makes them more vulnerable to natural disasters, and may keep them trapped in a poverty cycle (see for example chambers, 1995). the latter conclusion cannot be further substantiated in this study as the study merely provides a snapshot of the current situation. a more detailed time series analysis is required to test the hypothesis that poorer segments in society depending on just one or two natural sources of income are trapped in a downward poverty spiral. a similar situation is observed for preventive measures. floodplain households taking preventive measures earn higher incomes and have significantly lower damage costs in absolute and relative terms. also the implementation of preventive measures is constrained by limited financial resources, although a substantial proportion of floodplain residents do not take any preventive measures because they believe that flooding is a natural process, which cannot be prevented. regarding the availability of ex post disaster relief, we used information from semistructured key informant interviews to assess the existence of social networks and institutional arrangements to support flood victims. it appears that the availability of such community level support is generally rather low, although some degree of flood relief exists in the form of loans to flood victims from family members, neighbours, rich members of the community and credit for food from local shops. using the assumption that communities with a more equal income and wealth distribution are more likely to have social networks to provide flood relief, we find that villages with higher risk exposure also have more unequal income distributions, suggesting that they have a lower provision of community level organization to cope with flooding. we therefore find, somewhat paradoxically, that the people that face the highest risk of flooding are the least well prepared, both in terms of household-level ex ante preparedness and communitylevel ex post flood relief. there is clearly a need for more government involvement to either provide further flood protection and flood relief directly, or to stimulate household and community level efforts to protect and support flood victims. moreover, policies that pursue income equality may also be effective in that they will have important economic benefits in terms of avoided damage costs. as a final methodological note we want to emphasize that the analysis presented in this paper is primarily based on observed associations and relationships, using linear correlations and non-parametric testing procedures. an important question remains how much the observed relationships actually tell us about underlying (non-linear) causal relationships as suggested for example by adger (1999), and in which direction these causal relationships act. we believe that a more extended deterministic model is needed to further test these underlying causal relationships and their direction in future research in this domain. socio-economic vulnerability and adaptation to environmental risk 20"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who can I ask for questions about Microscale Meteorology?", "id": 6764, "answers": [{"text": "julie national center for atmospheric research",

production and successful reception of the photographs as representative of an environment in need of protection. such aesthetics corresponds to the discursive production of the landscape and environment since the enlightenment. as many cultural theorists have shown, images of the landscape have come to define what the environment is and how it is to be understood (urry, 1990; wilson, 1992; macnaughten and urry, 1998). where the visualisation of the environment can be understood as an epistemology of environmental discourse, greenpeace, i would argue, subscribes to and reinforces these representational conditions. yet this commitment to the beautiful and spectacular becomes problematic in the context of climate change communication. the persuasive power of current comparative

adaptation--are not yet considered in national adaptation policies, which may result in even higher vulnerability for forests and forest-dependent people and sectors. therefore, innovative policy approaches are needed to recognise both the need for adaptation policies that encourage the adaptive management of forest, and the need for policies that engage other sectors which benefit from forest ecosystem services in forest adaptation. policies promoting adaptation for forests national policies that aim to promote the adaptation of forests to climate change should follow multiple objectives. first, they should reduce non-climatic threats to forests; for example, land use change, fragmentation or degradation by unsustainable harvesting practices. removing maladaptation policies goes in that direction and aims at identifying other policy instruments that increase forest vulnerability; for example, incentives to biofuels or other crops competing with forest lands. second, policies should encourage large-scale decision making for the management of forest or more generally biodiversity. large landscape approaches are needed for designing and implementing forest adaptation measures (hansen et al. 2003). third, conservation policies must explicitly include climate change as a driver of change (hannah et al. 2002; killeen and solorzano 2008). for instance, the design of national systems of protected areas and biological corridors must consider the vulnerability of the protected ecosystem and the role of corridors for facilitating migration of species under scenarios of climate change (iucn 2003). fourth, policies should try to promote information sharing about forest adaptation and establish monitoring systems for the impact of climate change on forests. the

photosynthesis, and thus dependent on incoming radiation. the potential for production determined by the radiation is greatly modified by temperature and rainfall. the main effect of temperature is to control the duration of the growing period (long and woodward, 1988). moreover, also other processes linked with the accumulation of dry matter (leaf area expansion, photosynthesis, respiration, evapotranspiration etc.) are affected by temperature. rainfall and soil water availability may affect the duration of growth through leaf area duration and the photosynthetic efficiency through stomatal closure. also animal behaviour and production are affected by these factors. these like man are homoeotherms, thus they have a comfort zone within which the climatic factors produce no stress on the metabolism. when ambient heating exceeds or is insufficient to maintain temperature within this zone, cold and heat stresses are produced. these stresses may be mediated by low temperatures, precipitation and high wind speeds, or by high temperatures and droughts, respectively. both stresses cause lower food and higher water intake, which results in lower general performance (fuquay, 1989). moreover climatic factors have indirect 10 effects on animal production (loss in weight and condition) via decreases in quality and quantity of forage. these general climatic constraints on agricultural production are modified by local climatic constraints. in northern countries the length of growing season, late spring and early autumn frost and solar radiation availability are typical climatic constraints. in these environments the duration of the growing season (frost or snow free period) limits the productivity of crops. for example in germany the growing season is one to three months longer than in scandinavian countries (mela, 1996). the short growing season is the main cause of the lower cereal grain yields in the nordic countries. moreover, night frosts in the late spring or early autumn increase the agricultural risk in these environments. the wet conditions along the atlantic coast and in the mountainous regions causing cold and rainy summers limit the availability of solar radiation and cause yield and quality losses in many arable crops. this is the main reason for the low cereal area on the british isles and alpine countries compared with other regions. in mediterranean countries cereal yields are limited by water availability, heat stress and short duration of the grain filling period. cereals are therefore less import in this region. permanent crops (olive, grapevine, fruit trees etc.) are important here. these crops are affected by extreme weather events (such as hail and storms) which can reduce or completely destroy yield. irrigation is important for crop production in many mediterranean countries due to high evapotranspiration and restricted rainfall. the continental climate of eastern europe (from central poland and eastwards) causing drier conditions and greater amplitude of the annual temperature cycle limits the range of crops that can be grown. the most productive regions in europe in terms of climate and soils are located in the great european plain stretching from southeast england through france, benelux and 11 germany into poland. there are additional lowland regions, e.g. hungarian plains, where equally favourable conditions are available. the range of european forests is limited primarily by climate, either through moisture availability or through temperature (both absolute amounts and seasonal distributions) (berninger, 1997). some forests (particularly in the north) are also nutrient-limited. the structure and composition of many forests is further influenced by the natural disturbance regime (fire, insects, wind-throw etc.). most european forests are managed for one or several purposes, such as timber production, water resources, or recreation. this management has reduced forest area or strongly modified forest structure in most of europe, and presently existing forests often consist of species that are different from those that would occur naturally. examining in details the influence of climate on european forests, the existing south-north climate gradient implies decreasing temperature and increasing humidity with decreasing water limitation and increasing temperature limitation for forests. whilst, on the west-east climate gradient, the maritime climate turns to the continental one with decreasing humidity and increasing water limitation for forests. in line with these gradients over europe, and as already reported previously, the forests many divided into boreal forests (boreal zone), atlantic forests (humid temperate forests), continental forests (dry temperate forests) and mediterranean forests. in the boreal forest, the growth and productivity are manly limited by winter temperatures that determine the length of the growing season through the duration of snow cover and soil frost. in atlantic forests strong winds play in determining a forest productivity through their effects on evapotranspiration and then water availability. in the southern parts of the atlantic forests, in the continental and mediterranean forests the summer precipitations are the main 12 constraint factor of forest growth and productivity through their role in determining the frequency of droughts."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What impacts could high sea level have?", "id": 8134, "answers": [{"text": "along the north shore of prince

20-40 cm, similar crown sizes and an overall healthy appearance (lacking visible damage, and/or insect or disease infestation). from each tree we then collected two 5-mm-diameter increment cores at breast height, to a depth that included the pith, to characterize individual tree growth history. cores were taken at 90deg angles to one another. however, if the tree had a visible lean to the trunk or was growing on a hill, cores were taken at a 90deg angle from the axis of lean and/or perpendicular to the slope of the hill to minimize possible inclusion of compression or opposite wood in the

melting of the greenland ice sheet, which may impact the future amoc, and thereby the climate. in this study, the extent to which the mean climate influences the freshwater release linked to ice sheet

(2001) developed a model to explain the causes of error in aviation maintenance. the study investigated the influence of organisational, job, and individual variables on errors using structural equation modelling (sem). the results suggested that the effect of organisational level factors on errors is mediated by individual level factors, such as health and stress. a similar study by lawton (1998) examined the causes of violations among railway shunters working in the united kingdom. although the outcome variable was different in each case (errors versus violations), both models showed individual level variables mediating the relationship between organisational factors and measures of unsafe behaviour. fogarty and neal (2002) combined these two variables in their work on the causes of both violations and errors in the construction industry. the authors hypothesised that safety climate variables would predict violations, whereas individual level variables would predict errors. the relations among the variables used by fogarty and neal are modelled in figure 1. as illustrated by the model, safety climate variables are seen as impacting directly on violations and the personal resources of employees. the employees' resources influence the psychological strain they feel, which is directly responsible for safety climate and the theory of planned behaviour 4 the numbers of errors they make. according to fogarty and neal, there is also a causal link between violations and errors. one weakness of models based on the safety climate approach is that they one weakness of models based on the safety climate approach is that they don't appear to draw upon explanatory accounts of behaviour developed within mainstream psychology, yet there are some points where connections

this dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. simulated yields with bias corrected

tipping possibilities raise the optimal carbon tax more strongly over time. the resulting policy paths ultimately lower optimal peak warming by up to 0.5*c. different types of post-tipping shifts in dynamics generate qualitatively different optimal pre-tipping policy paths. jel: q54, d90, h23 keywords: tipping point, threshold, regime shift, climate, integrated assessment, social cost of carbon,

suggest that components of the earth system can shift abruptly in response to the ongoing ramp-up of greenhouse gases (alley et al., 2003; overpeck and cole, 2006; lenton et al., 2008). integrated climate-economy models provide formal frameworks for analyzing the diverse intertemporal tradeoffs at the heart of climate policy. for instance, the u.s. government used these models to estimate the social cost of carbon for cost-benefit analyses of legislation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the beginning of new century?", "id": 2361, "answers": [{"text": "now, a hundred years later, and at

being fuelled by a new variety of the determinist fallacy. although distinct from the politically and ethically discredited climate determinism epitomised by ellsworth huntington and his followers, climate has regained some of its former power for 'explaining' the performance of environments, peoples and societies. in seeking to predict a climate-shaped future, the complexity of interactions between climates, environments and societies is reduced and a new variant of climate determinism emerges. i call this 'climate reductionism', a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies which shape human life within the physical world. once isolated, climate is then elevated to the role of dominant predictor variable. i argue in this paper that climate reductionism is a methodology that has become dominant in analyses of present and future environmental change - and that as a methodology it has deficiencies. this way of thinking and analysing finds expression in some of the balder (and bolder) claims made by scientists, analysts and commentators about the future impacts of anthropogenic climate change. here are some examples of claims in which emerge from this climate reductionist form of analysis: * every year climate change leaves over 300,000 people dead; * we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species ... will be 'committed to extinction'; * 185 million people in sub-saharan africa alone could die of disease directly attributable to climate change by the

rajasthan to provide biogas cooking stoves for rural villagers near a remote tiger reserve 7,000 kilometres away are unlikely ever to have the chance to verify what effects the project is having on local wood-gathering practices or class relations, much less its climatic effects (ghosh and kill, forthcoming).yet they are encouraged to believe that they can understand all factors relevant to the transaction. fourth in a classic instance of ignoring their own background assumptions, carbon trading proponents have overgeneralized the lessons of the sulphur dioxide trading system that has been in place in the us since the1990s the only pollution market to date that has not been an unambiguous failure, and the main model for the carbon market set up by the kyoto protocol of 1997. the us so2 market was made possible by the relative simplicity of the regulatory task (achieving modest numerical cuts in a single industrial pollutant emitted by a comparatively small group of sources), the possibility of establishing clear property rights in pollution dumps (which were handed over free to polluting corporations) and the recent invention of continuous emissions monitoring equipment capable to transmitting emissions data to washington, dc in near realtime. carbon traders are compelled to make the false assumption that similar property rights arrangements, measurement systems and enforcement will be available for global carbon trading. this assumption is demonstrably false on numerous grounds. first, the sulphur dioxide trading system was not complicated by the presence of offsets, or special pollution-saving projects designed to inject additional pollution rights into the market; most carbon markets are. this is important since, second, measurement of offsets is impossible even in principle (lohmann, 2001, 2005). third, even without taking offsets into consideration, the measurements necessary to support a credible carbon market are not being made, even in many technically advanced european countries. fourth, the highly centralized enforcement systems that carbon trading requires are absent in most countries of the world. fifth, the question of who owns the world's carbon dumps, and how they gain that ownership, is becoming increasingly contested in a way that ownership of sulphur dioxide dumps in the us was not. for instance, european governments'free gift of carbon pollution rights to their biggest industrial polluters under the european union emissions trading scheme has become an international scandal in view of the windfall profits being made by fossil fuel-fired power generators under the system. fifth most existing and contemplated carbon markets trade both in emissions allowances and in carbon credits produced by offset projects, which then are exchanged for each other. it is even written into the kyoto protocol that offsets are emissions reductions. however, this is false. offset projects involve planting trees, fertilizing oceans to stimulate carbon-gobbling algae, burning methane from landfills to generate electricity or setting up wind farms none of these things can be verified to be climatically equivalent to each other or to reducing one's fossil fuel"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does green indicate?", "id": 12635, "answers": [{"text": "green indicates regions of agreement between vns and

coverage of weather stations (fig. 1). it is impossible to assess the statistical accuracy of climate surfaces for areas that lack station coverage, such as high montane and arctic environments. it has been pointed out that different interpolation techniques applied to northern canada and montane environments produce rather different climate surfaces that nevertheless converge at weather station locations to produce identical statistical accuracies (mbogga et al. 2010). finally, all interpolated climate surfaces used in this study are ultimately based on standard weather stations (shaded temperature sensors located at 1.5-m height in open areas). consequently, microclimate driven by small-scale topography such as aspect, slope, and frost pockets, and geographic features such as rivers and lakes are not captured. vegetation cover can also influence the local climate; for example, forest canopies are usually cooler during the day and warmer during the night than open areas. the reference evaporation is calculated for a grass surface with no soil moisture restrictions. values for other surfaces such as forest or lakes and for locations with limited soil moisture storage capacity or topographic shading will likely be different. therefore, when climatewna is used to generate climate data at fine scales and for specific locations, it is necessary to be aware that while

record, an observation that is consistent with the explanation for other outbreaks in russia and romania, although collection of longer time-series data would aid interpretation. evidence is being collected to document the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne fl aviviruses in central europe. globally, wnv is the most widespread fl avivirus. however, despite a long-term presence in europe, it has rarely been associated with clinical symptoms. however, in 2008 a relatively large outbreak occurred in northern italy, affecting humans as well as birds and horses; and in hungary, spreading into austria, there was an extensive outbreak of the virus in birds of prey, sheep and horses with some human infection (mild meningitis). the evidence suggests that the virus is now overwintering as a resident pathogen and that climate warming will spread the infection such that europe could face a situation with wnf similar to that in the usa. to prepare public health authorities for this possibility, it is important to institute a european lineagespecifi c wnv surveillance programme covering birds, mosquitoes and horses as well as humans. this requires increased collaboration between the human health and veterinary sectors. the emergence of other new fl aviviruses in europe is exemplifi ed by usutu virus, never previously observed outside (sub-)tropical africa but associated in 2001 with an outbreak of avian mortality in austria. this virus spread in bird populations within austria up to 2003 and then declined, possibly attributable to the development of herd immunity. although no human encephalitis was detected, there were cases of rash and specifi c antibodies measured in a signifi cant number of asymptomatic individuals. the same viral strain has also now been found in hungary, switzerland and italy. the conclusions drawn from this case study were that usutu virus too could survive the austrian winter, has adapted to european mosquito species and established effective transmission between local mosquitoes and birds. it has become a resident pathogen that might spread further. there is less evidence to conclude that climate change can explain other recent global trends in arboviral distribution and incidence. modelling studies suggest that the spread of dengue in the americas might be explained by increases in temperature and rainfall subject to the infl uence of the underlying climate. if the climate is already hot and wet, further change may have little infl uence on dengue transmission10. the interpretation of the epidemiology of japanese encephalitis is also complex: although there has been some expansion into south asia, rates in japan have declined, perhaps because of vaccination. chikungunya the increased incidence and geographical distribution of chikungunya, most recently in italy, might be interpreted more easily as a result of globalisation, specifi cally the trade in used tyres, a good breeding ground for the

accuracy of such information. the second part examines approaches to characterizing the vulnerability of decision makers and to elucidating the configuration of options and obstacles that farmers face in using climate forecasts to mitigate risk. the complexities of farmers' decisions and the difficulties of identifying the exact role that climate predictions play (and, therefore, of directly

indicators of adaptive capacity, which were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 558 coffee producers. exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were then condensed into an index of vulnerability, and adaptation strategies were identified in participatory workshops. models predict that all target countries will experience a decrease in climatic suitability for growing arabica coffee, with highest suitability loss for el salvador and lowest loss for mexico. high vulnerability resulted from loss in climatic suitability for coffee production and high sensitivity through variability of yields and out-migration of the work force. this was combined with low adaptation capacity as evidenced by poor post harvest infrastructure and in some cases poor access to credit and

this indicates that the warming effect on snowmelt pattern may be site specific. flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between unusually warm year (1998) and normal year (2001). in contrast, flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. the number of flowering species in a fellfield community was large in the middle to late june and the middle to late july. flowering of an early-melt snowbed community showed a peak in the middle of flowering season, and that of a late-melt snowbed community showed a peak in early flowering season. these habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, peucedanum multivittatum along the snowmelt gradient during five years. when flowering occurred prior to early august, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. when flowering occurred later than early august, however, plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. this is probably because the availability of pollinators depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. these results suggest that the effects of climate

comparative static cge models can usefully highlight the structural adjustments triggered by climate change impacts, by contrasting a baseline equilibrium at some reference year with a counterfactual one, obtained by shocking a set of parameters. in a dynamic model like ices, parameters are varied in a similar way, but in each period of the sequence of temporary equilibria. we run the model at

having a more efficient allocation of existing supplies. water that is saved reduces the need for costly infrastructure. one adaptation strategy is to enhance mechanisms for market-based transfers of water among uses. climate change and shifting patterns of demand may increase market pressures that today are moving water from one use to another. increased use of voluntary water leasing, water banks, and water markets can increase the opportunity for water rights holders to shift water among users. transfers can either be permanent by purchasing water rights or temporary by having contracts to purchase water during dry years. markets and higher prices provide an incentive to adopt water conservation, particularly during periods of limited supply and drought. another strategy is to reduce overall water consumption through conservation and efficiency improvements. municipal water utilities can encourage water conservation by individual metering and pricing. the agricultural sector can reduce water consumption by changing the selection of crops and irrigation methods and by adopting technological innovations such as drought-resistant plant varieties. most measures to reduce demand are implemented at the local level or by individual producers and households. the water-management agencies can continue to promote wateruse efficiency in several sectors, as well in their own

government also has a lead role in research that produces technological advances that can reduce water use per capita. as noted earlier, population growth in semiarid regions of the country has increased the demand for limited water supplies and has heightened vulnerability to drought. more population in flood plains and coastal areas has increased flood risk and has increased public demand

the main reservoir of rvf in africa, strongly depends on the rainfall pattern (27). aedes females lay eggs in pond mud. although these eggs become desiccated when ponds dry up, they remain viable for several years or even decades in the dry mud. the ovaries and ovarian ducts in a mosquito infected with rvf can transmit the virus to the nascent eggs. when infected via transovarial transmission, eggs allow the virus to persist in the field during dry and/or inter-epizootic periods. eggs need to be flooded to hatch. heavy rainfall results in a massive hatching episode and, consequently, the development of a large vector population. then, once infection has been amplified in livestock, secondary vectors such as culex and anopheles spp., which breed in semi-permanent pools of water, become involved in the transmission of the virus. in east africa, outbreaks were clearly correlated with the unusual heavy rainfall associated with el nino (21), which consequently flooded many aedes

genetically programmed pre-emptive developmental response to changing seasons and environmental conditions. it is an environmentally adaptive dormancy that can occur during any stage of development (egg, larva, pupa or adult) but the diapausing stage is consistent and specific within a species. diapause is distinct from quiescence, which can occur at any stage in the life cycle and represents an immediate response to stress. most commonly, insects have a facultative diapause, in which there is a developmental stage that is responsive to specific environmental 'cues' (the sensitive stage) that programme the diapause. thus, the sensitive stage makes the 'physiological decision' to either diapause or delay entry into diapause for another generation (tauber et al., 1986; denlinger, 2002). species having an obligate diapause arrest development at the same developmental stage every generation regardless of prevailing environmental conditions. however, the exact seasonal timing of diapause initiation can vary from year to year, and between locations, because of differences in thermal developmental budgets, e.g. in the spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana (clem.) (han and bauce, 1998). in both the facultative and obligatory response, diapause represents an alternative developmental pathway, initiated by unique patterns of gene expression, which allows insects to survive seasonally recurring chronic forms of environmental stress, and to coordinate growth, development and reproduction with annual cycles of favourable environmental conditions (denlinger, 2002). both obligate and facultative diapause are likely to be affected by climate change but this review will primarily focus on facultative diapause. in temperate and polar zones, i.e. above 30degn latitude, day length is the primary cue programming diapause. this represents a strong, noise-free indicator of the changing seasons, and has remained highly reliable over evolutionary time. patterns of day length change will of course remain unaffected by climate change but their effectiveness as an indicator of seasonal changes in temperature may diminish. for each species of insect there is a critical day length (cdl), which will programme the diapause response. this is designated as the photoperiod that induces a 50% incidence of diapause, and changes with latitude, e.g. the cdl of the blow fly calliphora vicina (r-d) at 65degn is 16.5  h whereas at 51degn it is 14.5  h (mcwatters and saunders, 1996). this represents an adaptation to the fact that winter occurs earlier, and more rapidly, at higher latitudes, and small changes in photoperiod either side of the cdl produce a dramatic shift in diapause incidence (fig.  4). low temperature can enhance the diapause response (greater incidence and longer duration) but temperature by itself does not typically induce diapause. the adaptive significance of this seasonal response to changing day length, termed photoperiodism, lies in the anticipatory nature of switching off development and reproduction in preparation for winter, even when the immediate conditions may be favourable (bradshaw and holzapfel, 2010). thus, diapause is a pivotal point in the life cycle of insects and crucial to the survival of seasonal adversity. furthermore, given the diverse roles insects play in ecosystem function, many other processes are synchronous with the diapause programme (plant consumption/pollination, predator-prey interactions, etc.). consequently, any disruption of diapause as a result of climate change could have profound effects on ecosystem stability."}, {"qas": [{"question": "According to the text what considered as important in the implementation of the distance-based velocity algorithm?", "id":

cell and a nearby grid cell that has a similar value in the future. given enough precision in measurements, no two grid cells will have the same climate value, and this becomes obvious when matching cells in multivariate climate space. this decision could be informed by biological data, for example, if the climate tolerances of an organism are known. however, for a general landscape analysis we find it useful to set the threshold as small as possible while avoiding artefacts due to using excessive precision (fig. 2a). generally, the required migration distances increase linearly and monotonically with smaller thresholds, but beyond a certain point velocities increase rapidly driven by more random climate matches. for example, if the algorithm has to search for a climate match to a present cell with a value of 5.36 deg c, and the value of a nearby future climate cell of 5.32 deg c is rejected, then large and small distances start to occur by random chance and the resulting surfaces become noisy (fig. 2a, left inset). in the example shown in fig. 2, a good threshold would be  0.2 deg c. the resulting maps of velocity equal or higher to this value remain very robust, until the threshold exceeds the warming signal so that the required migration distance is by definition zero. another factor that influences the velocity estimates, and that depends on user choices is the spatial resolution of the gridded climate data. for both loarie's slope method and the distance-based method proposed in this paper, median velocities increase in the same monotonic fashion (fig. 3). maximum velocities for the distance-based method are not resolution dependent, while they decrease substantially for the slope-based method. the decrease in the slope-based method arises from the fact that at coarser resolutions it becomes less likely that surrounding cells all have the same elevation and temperature values, and therefore yield very high velocity estimates. conversely, the distance-based method shows stronger resolution dependence for the minimum distance. this is due to the minimum velocity value being restricted by the distance to the nearest neighbour grid cell. we therefore recommend use of gridded data with as high resolution as is computationally feasible and justifiable based on the precision of interpolated climate grids."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what do

credibility to the set of measures, but it also contributes to improving understanding of vulnerability and hence the representation of processes in indicator studies. in the case of the deductive approach, verification involves assessment of the goodness of fit between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence. to some extent, this work will have been undertaken before the indicator study was started, as existing theory provides the basis of the deductive approach. but the indictor study then provides a framework for further testing and verification and the further development of the conceptual framework. in the case of the inductive approach, the statistical analysis, if conducted rigorously, must incorporate verification of any results through testing on independent data as an aspect of good practice. having said that, for a variety of reasons, verification has been limited in existing studies of climate vulnerability indicators. the selection of indicators and the measurement process represent a theoretical reasoning and prediction (blalock 1984). the indicators selected on the basis of the deductive approaches can be tested against measures of adversity evident in the observed outcomes of past climatic events, as analogues of possible future conditions (parry and carter 1998). the adversity encountered in connection with a particular event can be measured more or less directly using well-established measures such as death, illness, hunger or loss of property (fivims 2000, brooks and adger 2003), although, as discussed earlier, available national-level data are not unproblematic. such a test is highly context specific, given that the dynamic nature of vulnerability cannot be fully captured by a snapshot in time at a particular point in space. moss et al. (2001) propose that past case studies collectively \"provide a benchmark with which to corroborate qualitative assessments of adaptive capacity\" (p. 5). parry and carter also suggest that analysis tools can be tested and evaluated through conducting 'microcosm' case studies, small-scale pilot studies under conditions representative of the main study. an example of an indicator study that performs such verification is the heinz center study (2002) of the united states, albeit at county rather than national level. the study provides a conceptual framework of vulnerability and a description of the understanding of vulnerability that underlies the selection of factors for investigation. the list of selected population characteristics influencing social vulnerability is found

from the same genotype exposed to different water soil availabilities, with differences up to 0.63 mpa. these results suggest that phenotypic plasticity accounts for a large part of the within-species

"context": "this study diagnoses the climate sensitivity, radiative forcing and climate feedback estimates from eleven general circulation models participating in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (cmip5), and analyzes inter-model differences. this is done by taking into account the fact that the climate response to increased carbon dioxide (co2) is not necessarily only mediated by surface temperature changes, but can also result from fast land warming and tropospheric adjustments to the co2 radiative forcing. by considering tropospheric adjustments to co2 as part of the forcing rather than as feedbacks, and by using the radiative kernels approach, we decompose climate sensitivity estimates in terms of feedbacks and adjustments associated with water vapor, temperature lapse rate, surface albedo and clouds. cloud adjustment to co2 is, with one exception, generally positive, and is associated with a reduced strength of the cloud feedback; the multi-model mean cloud feedback is about 33 weaker. non-cloud adjustments associated with temperature, water vapor and albedo seem, however, to be better understood as responses to land surface warming. separating out the tropospheric adjustments does not significantly affect the spread in climate sensitivity estimates, which primarily results from differing climate feedbacks. about 70 of the spread stems from the cloud feedback, which remains the major source of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, with a large contribution from the tropics. differences in tropical cloud feedbacks between low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity models occur over a large range of dynamical regimes, but primarily arise from the regimes associated with a predominance of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds. the combined water vapor plus lapse rate feedback also contributes to the spread of climate sensitivity estimates, with inter-model differences arising primarily from the relative humidity responses throughout the troposphere. finally, this study points to a substantial role of nonlinearities in the calculation of adjustments and feedbacks for the interpretation of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity estimates. we show that in climate model simulations with large forcing (e.g., 4 9 co2), nonlinearities cannot be assumed minor nor neglected. having said that, most results presented here are consistent with a number of previous feedback studies, despite the very different nature of the methodologies and all the uncertainties associated with them. keywords climate

(#4) caution that complacency towards climate change poses significant barriers in europe, with a lack of awareness of potential dangers constraining action. financial barriers, lack of information on the necessity to adapt, knowledge about available options, and the ability to implement most suitable ones, were not widely noted. 4 discussion traditional literature reviews are useful for characterizing the broad contours of knowledge on a given area, but are less suited to answering specific questions such as posed here: are developed nations adapting to climate change? questions of this nature require systematic review methodologies where explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed to identify and analyze relevant literature. herein, we develop and apply a mixed-methods review methodology, creating a database of publications reporting on adaptation actions in developed nations. we do not argue that the database captures all adaptation actions being implemented, with interventions likely reported in the grey literature and in articles published outside of the 2006-2009 review period. what the work does offer, however, is a proxy or indicator of adaptation action at national/regional levels--a snapshot of what is going on--that can be used to monitor adaptation over time, and is consistent with calls for more timely analyses to compliment ipcc (oppenheimer et al. 2007 ). importantly, examining how adaptation is and is not taking place enables us to offer a number of insights of relevance to research and policy. firstly, while adaptation is being thought about widely, examples of actual intervention reported in the literature are limited, raising concerns about the likelihood of effective adaptation given the speed of climate change and limited window of opportunity for action (adger and barnett 2009 ). this is compounded by the often significant time requirements for adaptation development to progress from problem identification to actual implementation, as identified in articles reviewed here. where interventions are occurring we hypothesize that they represent action by early adopters, with adaptations typically at early stages of implementation. thus no studies examined here formally assess success of interventions or consider how adaptations will perform under different climate scenarios. adaptation reporting in unequal by region with actions only described in 14 annex-1 countries. there is also no evidence in the dataset of adaptation actions targeting vulnerable populations including non-arctic indigenous populations, along with women, elderly, and children. furthermore, while mainstreaming is evident, few studies describe the development of specific adaptation plans, which will be necessary in regions and sectors where future climatic conditions are expected to pose significant risks outside of those currently experienced (fussel 2007 ). secondly, as adaptations reviewed here illustrate, high adaptive capacity typically assumed for developed nations will not necessarily translate into effective adaptation action. thus--in addition to the concerns illustrated in the previous paragraph--a major challenge highlighted in a number of articles concerns the lack of political will to meaningfully address climate change impacts, particularly at local levels where a mismatch between national statements on adaptation and local action has been noted. in such cases adaptation interventions have preferred short term risk reduction over long term strategic planning,

arable land in some parts of the world. with heightened competition over diminishing and unequally distributed resources, conflict over resources is set to increase (hemmati, 2005; rohr, 2008). furthermore, conflicts resulting from non-inclusive processes around climate change mitigation strategies may be imminent as large scale clean development mechanisms (cdm) projects in the south, which share environmentally sound technologies developed in industrialised countries with developing countries, rarely involve consultation with local stakeholders (rohr, 2008). although there is currently little research explicitly linking climate change with both conflict and gender, there is a considerable body of work that exists on gender and conflict, from which lessons can and should be drawn. so what do we already know? innovative work has been carried out on engendering conflict early warning systems to better ensure that previously overlooked signs of instability are taken into account. these approaches could be usefully drawn on to help recognise when conflict over resources is imminent, and to potentially prevent the conflict from occurring. for example, the united nations development fund for women (unifem) has developed a set of gender-sensitive early warning indicators which include: increased gender-based violence, increased unemployment among male youths, reduced trust between ethnic groups, and a reduction in women's involvement over land disputes (moser 2007). many of these indicators reflect the projected effects of climate change on communities - particularly around depleting resources. in cases where conflict over resources does occur, the gender and conflict literature again presents useful insights which should be used to inform appropriate, gender-sensitive responses. for example, existing work on gender and conflict points to women and men's 'traditionally' differing roles in conflict - with men and boys expected to be combatants while women and girls are expected to maintain the home and community in men's absence. this points to the need for policies and programmes that respond to the different roles that women and men play in conflicts, including those over natural resources - for example, interventions that provide women with safe routes to collect water and firewood. the differential impacts of conflict on men and women are also well documented, and include gender and sexual based violence targeted particularly at women and girls; women's reduced access to resources to cope with household responsibilities; the increased time women and girls are required to spend caring for the injured and sick; as well as the obvious risk of death and disability faced by men engaged in armed conflict. the effects of natural resource conflicts on women and men can be clearly seen in existing conflicts. take for example the case of sudan. both the conflicts between the north and the natural resource rich south, and the conflict in darfur between nomadic and sedentary tribes, are partly a result of quarrels over natural resources. the horrific levels of sexual violence in darfur, particularly against women and girls, which occur in villages when men and boys are away fighting, in and around refugee and idp camps, and outside the camps at times when scarce fuel and water is being collected, provide a stark example of the gendered effects of climate-change related conflicts."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is broadly captured by most of the models?", "id": 2208, "answers": [{"text":

a clear link to the baroclinic activity over the north atlantic during boreal winter (djf). in large precipitation months the north atlantic storm track is shifted southward, more westerly and northwesterly circulation situations occur and moisture transports from the atlantic are enhanced. the occurrence of local cyclones and upper-level troughs is more frequent than in low precipitation months. the negative correlation to the nao is relatively strong, especially with gibraltar as a southern pole (-0.71). the northward shift of the storm track and eastward shift of the azores high predicted by the echam model for increasing ghg concentrations would therefore be associated with decreasing precipitation and potentially serious impacts for the future water supply for parts of morocco. in the region south of the atlas mountains, moisture transports from the atlantic along the southern flank of the atlas mountains associated with cyclones west of morocco and the iberian

independent ski area operators versus ski conglomerates). this, combined with the highly competitive nature of the ski industry, suggests that an unplanned, market-based contraction of the industry, a continuation of the historical trend in north america, represents its likely future in an era of climate change. hamilton et al. 2003 speculate that climate change during the latter half of the 20th-century partially contributed to the loss of hundreds of ski areas in the new england region of the us. the projected warming trend over the first five decades of the 21st century is also likely to have a similar or perhaps more pronounced affect in this region and other ski regions of north america and internationally. individual ski areas that are better climate adapted and with greater adaptive capacity (as defined by yohe and tol 2002 )) than their competitors will be the survivors in an era of climate change. the authors hypothesize that ski areas with greater adaptive capacity are characterized by the following: they have the potential to expand into higher elevation terrain where exposure to climate change is lower and snowmaking capabilities enhanced; they have capital to develop efficient and extensive snowmaking systems; they have the capacity to expand water supply for increased snowmaking; they have the capacity to further diversify resort operations (multiple winter activities and four-season operation); they are part of a larger company or regionally diversified ski conglomerate that could provide financial or human-resource support during poor business conditions; they are located in jurisdictions with less land use restrictions (e.g., outside of national parks or in states/ provinces where skiing makes a large contribution to the economy) and have positive relationships with host communities, both of which may reduce constraints to adaptation. although projected climate change would contribute to the demise of poorly adapted ski companies, it is likely to selectively advantage those that remain. assuming skier/rider demand remains relatively stable, then ski areas that remain could be in a position to take advantage of a climatically altered business environment, gaining market share (through lost competition) and potentially maintaining or even improving economic performance despite reduced ski seasons and higher operating costs

the risks and take advantage of any strategic opportunities posed by a changed climate. determining the potential 'winners and losers' in the ski industry, at both the individual ski area and destination level, remains an important task for future climate change vulnerability research. studies that only modeled future natural snow conditions and did not take snowmaking into account have

present-day forcings. as a consequence, the simulated 0 kyr cal bp vegetation cover at 12 1 e reaches 80% where desert is present in reality fig. 5b ). in the eastern sahara at 25 1 n, on the other hand, the precipitation rates are low throughout the experiment, even at 9 kyr cal bp, so that here the 9 kyr cal bp vegetation cover is locally below 25%, while it was probably higher in the early holocene. this implies that here the ahp termination cannot be simulated in a reliable way in our model and that the range of the simulated area with high variability fig. 5c should be treated with

approach between biologists and other disciplines, particularly economists. studies in this area are, of necessity, correlational rather than experimental, and as a result, assignment of causation is inferential. this inference often comes from experimental studies of the effects of temperature and precipitation on the target species or on a related species with similar habitats. confidence in this inferential process is subjective, and differs among disciplines, thus resulting in the first divergence of opinion within the ipcc. the second impasse came from differences in perspective on what constitutes an 'important' factor. anyone would consider a currently strong driver to be important, but biologists also attach importance to forces that are currently weak but are likely to persist. in contrast, economic approaches tend to discount events that will occur in the future, assigning little weight to weak but persistent forces. differences of opinion among disciplines can therefore stem naturally from whether the principal motivation is to assess the magnitude of immediate impacts or of long-term trajectories. most field biologists are convinced that they are already seeing important biological impacts of climate change1-4,6-9; however, they have encountered difficulty in convincing other academic disciplines, policy-makers and the general public. here, we seek to improve communication, provide common ground for discussion, and give a comprehensive summary of the evidence. how should a 'climate fingerprint' be defined? a straightforward view typical of an economist would be to conclude that climate change was important if it were principally responsible for a high proportion of current biotic changes. by this criterion a climate fingerprint appears weak. most short-term local changes are not caused by climate change but by land-use change and by natural fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of species. this fact has been used by non-biologists to argue that climate change is of little importance to wild systems10. this approach, however, effectively ignores small, systematic trends that may become important in the longer term. such underlying trends would be confounded (and often swamped) by strong forces such as habitat loss. biologists have tended to concentrate on studies that minimize confounding factors, searching for trends in relatively undisturbed systems and then testing for significant associations with climate change. economists have viewed this as biased (nonrandom exclusion of data) whereas biologists view this as reducing non-climatic noise. thus, economists focus on total direct evidence and apply heavy time discounting; biologists apply a 'quality control' filter to available data, accept indirect (inferential) evidence and don't apply time discounting. the test for a globally coherent climate fingerprint does not require that any single species show a climate change impact with 100% certitude. rather, it seeks some defined level of confidence in a climate change signal on a global scale. adopting the ipcc 'levels of confidence'11and applying the economists' view of a fingerprint, we would have \"very high confidence\" in a fingerprint if we estimated that more than 95% of observed changes were principally caused by climate change, \"high confidence\" between 95% and 67%, \"medium confidence\" between 33% and 67%, and \"low confidence\" below 33%. in contrast, the biologists' confidence level comes from the statistical probability that global biotic trends would match climate change predictions purely by chance, coupled with supporting experimental results showing causal relationships between climate and particular biological traits. here, we present quantitative estimates of the global biological impacts of climate change. we search for a climate fingerprint in the overall patterns, rather than critiquing each study individually. using the biologists' approach, we synthesize a suite of correlational studies on diverse taxa over many regions to ask whether natural systems, in general, have responded to recent climate change. furthermore, we attempt a cross-fertilization by applying an economists' measure--the estimated proportion of observed changes for which climate trends are the principal drivers--to data sets chosen using biologists' criteria. we call this a 'global coherence' approach to the detection of climate change impacts. first, we explore a biologists' confidence assessment with two types of analyses of observed change: statistical meta-analyses of effect size in restricted data sets and more comprehensive categorical analyses of the full literature. second, we present a probabilistic model that considers three variables: proportion of observations matching climate change predictions, numbers of competing explanations for each of those observations, and confidence in causal"}, {"qas":

requires the specification of three primitives: the entity that is vulnerable, the stimulus to which it is vulnerable and a notion of \"worse\" and \"better\" with respect to the outcome. section 3 presented a mathematical translation of this result, grounded in systems theory. in addition, it introduced refinements that capture the informal concepts of adaptive capacity and mitigation. section 4 served as a first test of the framework by assessing whether it can represent concepts used in recent work of which the authors have first-hand knowledge. preliminary findings of this test include that the three determinants of vulnerability as identified by the ipcc correspond only in part with the three primitives of our formal framework and that ateam and dinas-coast have chosen not to specify the preorder on their models' respective outputs. instead, they specified several preorders on components of their outputs, leaving room for interpretation by the user. however, it has not been the purpose of this paper to evaluate these projects, in particular because the current version of the framework is too rudimentary for such a task. a more important finding is that the preparation of this paper has allowed and motivated scientists from very different disciplines (the authors, workshop participants and informal reviewers) to communicate clearly about an issue of common interest, thereby enriching each others' understanding of the issue. at the same time, it has shown that there is scope for many refinements, specialisations and applications of the framework, which means that much work remains to be done to develop it into a useful tool. the definitions in this paper aimed at showing that a certain type of mathematical theory can account for a simplified grammar of vulnerability rather than at being of immediate use to researchers in the field. a major part of the work to be done will concern structural refinements: formulating stronger, more precise definitions for more complex systems, in a way that makes it 24 easy to deal with continuous time, stochasticity, fuzziness, multiple agents, multiple scales, etc the problems of optimisation, mitigation and maintaining adaptive capacity must be formulated for these systems in ways that relate them to questions arising in vulnerability assessments. to do so will enable us to incorporate results from the fields of control theory, game theory and decision theory, which was, after all, one of the main motivations for developing our framework. these theoretical developments should be accompanied by practical applications that elaborate on those in section 4. the analytical framework must be informed by the large body of results available from past case studies and by the needs of ongoing vulnerablity assessments. for example, we will interact with the case-study teams involved in the project newater so as to develop a systematic way of including indicator-based approaches in our framework. as mentioned in section 1, it is increasingly argued that the climate change community could benefit from experiences gained in food security and natural hazards studies. these communities have their own well-developed fields of research on vulnerability, although there are important differences with vulnerability assessment carried out in the context of climate change [5, 22]. the framework proposed in this paper could be used to analyse approaches to vulnerability assessment in these communities, as well as in the climate change community. this could make more explicit and thus lead to better understanding of the perceived and real differences between the respective models of vulnerability in use. moreover, it will serve to test the framework proposed here. it will be a challenge to see whether the framework can capture in mathematical terms the complexity and richness of individual communities, sectors and regions, as well as of the factors leading to their vulnerability. in addition, the value of the framework for qualitative approaches to vulnerability assessment needs to be demonstrated, especially in those places where data are scarce. on a final note, we realise that some may perceive a formal framework as limiting the flexibility required to capture the breadth and diversity of issues relevant to vulnerability assessment. others may consider the mathematical approach to developing the framework as an impediment to discussion and application. as stated before, the framework is not intended to be prescriptive, nor is it meant to exclude non-mathematical viewpoints on vulnerability. the least we hope to achieve is that our framework makes researchers aware of the potential confusion that can arise from not being precise about fundamental concepts underpinning their research. at the most, we hope they will recognise the potential benefits of testing, applying and further developing 25 the framework proposed here. every attempt has been made to make the formal description of the framework as accessible as possible to the mathematically challenged, a group that includes the second author of this paper."}, {"qas":

treatment this assumption is not valid, since there is a multiple population assimilating a multiple substrate due to these aspects, the monod relation has been the target of criticism from the specialised literature. however, a more satisfactory relation has not yet been developed, and the monod equation maintains its importance, being adopted in practically all mathematical models of biological wastewater treatment. a great advantage of the monod equation resides in its structure that permits the representation in a continuous form of the range of variation between the extremes of lack and abundance of nutrients in the medium. therefore, depending on the value of s, the monod equation can represent approximately the kinetics of zero and first orders, as well as the transition between them. in the case of a substrate removal reaction, when its concentration is still high and not limiting, the global removal rate approaches the zero-order kinetics. with the consumption of

north atlantic, and they presented a far richer resource, and one much less likely to be depleted by large scale exploitation, than the small resident harbor phoca vitulina and grey seal halichoerus gryphus colonies of iceland or the british isles. norse archaeofauna in greenland from the earliest phases have far more seal bones than appear in any of the other north atlantic bone collections (perdikaris and mcgovern in press c), and there is a general tendency for the relative percentages of seal bones to increase through time--topping 70% of the total in some smaller sites (mcgovern et al 1996, mcgovern 2000). isotopic evidence from human remains clearly indicates an increasing marine component in norse diet in greenland, suggesting that the seal hunt and other marine foraging played a progressively more vital role in subsistence (arneborg, et al. 1999). norse migratory seal hunting in greenland was thus both highly productive and capable of expansion and intensifi cation, and the norse communal seal hunters were not only able to provision their communities without inuit technology, but also capable of continuing to expand seal catches as long as labor and boats were available. the norse seal hunters were thus no less competent than the inuit, but they made far greater use of pooled communal labor and carefully scheduled targeting of seasonal concentrations of migratory seals rather than more individualistic year-round sealing with harpoons from kayak or ice edge. communal seal harvesting, which probably involved most active adults in the community and distributed seal meat to every farm (even far inland), must have had a signifi cant social dimension, hedged about with tradition and representing an annual expression of communal solidarity and cooperation (mcgovern 1985a, 1991). the faroe islands, where hunting of the pilot whale globicephala melus has occurred for at least 500 years and probably since the viking age and has provided a signifi cant part of the staple diet for centuries, may provide a social as well as economic model for communal seal hunting in greenland (gibson-lonsdale 1990; guttesen 1996). in times of subsistence crisis, whales have provided a key resource to the faroese, a point vividly demonstrated during the second world war when in 1941 a.d. a record catch of 4,325 pilot whales provided a vital food supply

climate' by looking at variations in past climate38,39, and this historical perspective is still relevant27; a warming of more than 2 degc would exceed temperature levels of the past several million years, and would move climate outside the bounds of the epoch in which our society developed. a comparison with the past is relevant for natural systems, but not straightforward for human systems. our

growing. there is no doubt that unmitigated climate change will take us outside a climate regime that humanity has experienced. it is extremely likely that most of the warming since about 1950 is human-induced13, and it is therefore in our control to either halt it or let it go unmitigated. the 2 degc target as a policy goal can be traced back to the early 1990s40. the ipcc frames the

arthropod-borne9. there is evidence to show that hantavirus global epidemiology is driven by local rodent population dynamics (the main rodent species in europe are the yellow-necked mouse and the bank vole). for example, there is accumulating information that the dynamics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (hfrs, caused by puumala hantavirus) in finland, where there has been a dramatic increase in clinical incidence since 1990, can be attributed to changes in the geographical synchrony of vole cycles. rodent population dynamics are infl uenced both by direct and indirect climatic effects on local biodiversity in europe, for example changes in seasonality and precipitation patterns associated with the north atlantic oscillation (a large-scale pattern of natural climate variability in the north atlantic ocean). recent research from literature cited at the greifswald meeting (ims et al. 2008) identifi es climate forcing as the underlying cause for collapsing population cycles in voles. however, interpretation of the experimental data remains challenging because only short time-series observations are available and there is imperfect understanding of the time-lag between environmental change and clinical infection. in addition, any attempts to predict the temporal and spatial risk of climate change on hantavirus infection in temperate and boreal europe must recognise that the complex fl uctuations in rodent population dynamics are also infl uenced by predator populations (in turn also subject to climate change impact), changes in landscape and variations in distribution of different virus carrier species. moreover, although warming will affect the distribution and dynamics of rodent carrier species and their food supply, the assessment of any hantavirus infection also needs to take account of changes in human behaviour (such as rural tourism) and governmental policy (particularly relating to housing and agriculture in rural areas) that will increase human exposure to the vector and host in forest habitats. clinical emergence of arboviral diseases arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause more than 130 human diseases, for example wnf, japanese encephalitis, tbe, chikungunya and dengue, with mosquitoes, ticks and sand-fl ies serving as the principal vectors. the basic transmission cycle involves arthropod-animal host amplifi cation, with humans acting as a dead-end host (whose viraemia (presence of virus in the blood) does not achieve a suffi ciently high level to infect arthropods). experimental studies show that increasing temperature variably infl uences the survival rates of immature and mature forms of the vector but consistently shortens the extrinsic incubation period (the interval between initial

in water or energy balance tend to influence climate on smaller spatial scales than changes in carbon uptake because co2 is a well-mixed gas. biophysical feedbacks are therefore relatively more important for regional than global climate, although their cumulative effect at the global scale can be significant. comparison of physical feedbacks with ghg feedbacks is complicated by at least three factors. first, the spatial scale of influence can differ significantly, and therefore the relative importance of physical and ghg effects will be a function of the scale and climate variable of interest. second, the relative importance of physical and ghg feedbacks will also change with time. for example, the climate effects of co2 losses from an ecosystem will diminish through time as the atmosphere equilibrates with the ocean and some of the co2 is absorbed by the ocean. in contrast, changes in surface albedo will cause a persistent change in net absorbed radiation at the surface that will equally affect current and future climates. third, whereas changes in surface albedo can be expressed as a radiative forcing, changes in factors such as energy partitioning do not involve a net change in absorbed radiation and therefore cannot be evaluated within the traditional framework of radiative forcing used for ghgs (124). given these difficulties, earth system models that simulate

(2004), areas with better infrastructure are expected to have a higher capacity to adapt to climate change. in their analysis of the vulnerability of indian agriculture to climate charge, for example, o'brien et al. included india's infrastructure development index--which includes the availability of transportation, irrigation, banking, communication, education, and health facilities--to measure adaptive capacity. irrigation potential and literacy rate are other important factors contributing to adaptation to climate change. irrigation potential was selected because of the assumption that places with more potentially irrigable land are more adaptable to adverse climatic conditions (o'brien et al. 2004). literacy rate is often included to approximate the level of skills and education of a region. smith and lenhart (1996) argued that countries with higher levels of stores of human knowledge are considered to have greater adaptive capacity than are developing nations and those in transition. sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate change stimuli, whereas exposure is the nature and degree to which a system is exposed to climate variations (ipcc 2001). the agricultural sector's sensitivity to climate change is represented by the frequency of climate extremes. in our study, it is argued that in places with a greater

penguin population of terre ade'lie, antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of ipcc climate models. based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (sica) affect adult survival and breeding success. demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual sica, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. we show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in sica. we identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in terre ade'lie. the output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of sica, which in turn drive the population model. uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. the median of these simulations predicts a decline of the terre ade'lie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. we find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. the uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. one such

tracks and dramatic changes in rainfall patterns and flood risk (kovats et al., 2003a). the second component, of key interest to this review, is long-term change associated with significant shifts in flood trends over multiple decades. it is important to consider the evidence for recent global flood trends and to address the notion that the incidence of flooding may already be increasing as a result of anthropogenic forcing, through alteration of greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere leading to climate change. to date, the evidence for recent upward trend in global flooding remains inconclusive, with no strong concensus emerging from the different global and regional studies. robson (2002) argues that no clear long-term evidence has emerged of an increased global flood trend during the last century. milly et al. (2002) report that the frequency of great floods - floods at 1/100 year levels - increased during the 20th century for large rivers in high-latitude regions of north america and eurasia. yet they found no evidence for an upward trend in floods of lesser magnitude. frei (2003) explains that, though there may appear to have been an accumulation of high-magnitude floods events over the last decade in europe; it is difficult to confirm statistically whether this constitutes a genuine trend because of the small number of actual events being considered. rather, it is preferable to analyse lower-order 'intense' events that are more common and therefore make it easier to detect a trend signal out of the background 'noise' of random variation. in this case, for europe, there does appear to have been a significant trend toward increased intense winter rainfall events over much of the continent in the last five decades. however, it remains unclear whether this change is related to climate change (frei, 2003). one of the problems of attributing a causal link between flood trends and climate change is that flood dynamics may have multiple drivers. the incidence of flooding is strongly affected by a range of environmental changes (bronstert, 2003; woodworth et al. in"}, {"qas": [{"question": "ENSO Say low frequency changes in Enzo?", "id": 7696, "answers": [{"text": "a number of recent studies (timmermann et al. 1999; an and jin 2000; fedorov and philander 2000; fedorov et al. 2003; urban et al. 2000; wang and an 2001, 2002) propose that the low-frequency changes in enso can be attributed to changes in the mean state of the coupled system", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "ENSO Tell me the average condition?", "id": 7697, "answers": [{"text": "an implicit assumption built into this proposal is that enso behavior is, to a large extent, controlled by the most unstable coupled mode whose characteristics depend sensitively on the mean state of the coupled system", "answer_start": 278}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "a number of recent studies (timmermann et al. 1999; an and jin 2000; fedorov and philander 2000; fedorov et al. 2003; urban et al. 2000; wang and an 2001, 2002) propose that the low-frequency changes in enso can be attributed to changes in the mean state of the coupled system. an implicit assumption built into this proposal is that enso behavior is, to a large extent, controlled by the most unstable coupled mode whose characteristics depend sensitively on the mean state of the coupled system. using a simple coupled ocean-atmosphere model, fedorov and philander (2000) explored the properties of the most unstable coupled mode in the parameter space spanned by the mean thermocline depth h and the mean strength of the trade wind stresses  their finding suggests that with a moderate change in h and/or  the dominant coupled mode can migrate from an sst-mode regime where the entrainment of cold"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Severinghaus and Brook discover in 1999?", "id": 20584, "answers": [{"text": "using an entirely independent methodology based on the temperature dependence of the diffusion of gases within the ice core, severinghaus and brook (1999) and severinghaus et al.

kind of climate change seen in the greenland ice cores almost perfectly fits lorenz's description of an 'almost intransitive' system: 'a particular solution extending over an infinite time interval will possess successive very long periods with markedly different sets of statistics' (lorenz 1968). lorenz developed this concept of climate change, which seems more relevant today than ever, even before the ice core data was available! in summary, abrupt climate changes, consisting of coolings followed by rapid coolings and then abrupt warmings, punctuated the entire glacial period at greenland but no such thing happened in antarctica. at greenland there is enticing evidence of nonlinearity of the climate system with thresholds and switches. the younger dryas is the most recent of these abrupt changes. much of the discussion to follow on the spatial and temporal structure of abrupt changes will concern the younger dryas, because this is the best observed, but it is anticipated

results need to be combined when using the full rcm ensemble. the process of constructing, assigning and combining metrics of model performance is not straightforward. rather, there is a considerable degree of subjectivity both in the choice of metrics and on how these may be combined into weights. we explore the applicability of combining a set of 6 specifically designed rcm performance metrics to produce one aggregated model weight with the purpose of combining climate change information from the range of rcms used within ensembles. these metrics capture aspects of model performance in reproducing large-scale circulation patterns, meso-scale signals, daily temperature and precipitation distributions and extremes, trends and the annual cycle. we examine different aggregation procedures that generate different inter-model spreads of weights. the use of model weights is sensitive to the aggregation procedure and shows different sensitivities to the selected metrics. generally, however, we do not find compelling evidence of an improved description of mean climate states using performance-based weights in comparison to the use of equal weights. we suggest that model weighting adds another level of uncertainty to the generation of ensemble-based climate projections, which should be suitably explored, although our results indicate that this uncertainty

regional atmospheric climate model. to that end, snow grain size was introduced as a new prognostic variable in the snowpack. for each model layer, snow grain size evolution is computed due to dry and wet metamorphism, and due to refreezing of locally produced melt water. the albedo parameterization by gardner and sharp [2010] makes use of snow grain size, optical thickness of clouds, and solar zenith angle. an altitude - dependent term has been added to account for varying optical thickness of the clear - sky atmosphere. application of the new parameterization to a 21 year run (1989 - 2009) over the antarctic continent shows that the new parameterization is capable of simulating subtle variations in albedo due to small amounts of melt water and short periods of intense snow metamorphism. moreover, the effect of cloud cover on albedo is taken care of in such a way that variability of the surface albedo is much more realistically simulated than with the old parameterization. in the application to present - day antarctic climate, the surface is always covered with snow, and its albedo rarely drops below values for older snow of about 0.75. for the use at locations where ice appears at the surface during the melt season, e.g., the greenland ablation area, or typical ice caps and glaciers, the parameterization presented here needs to be extended with a part that deals with ice albedo. the expressions by gardner and sharp [2010] can equally be applied to ice, in which enclosed air bubbles with size re' act as scatterers in an ice medium. however, one will need either a prognostic scheme for air bubble concentration and size, or these quantities have to be prescribed. as an alternative, one could work with a fixed albedo for ice surfaces. experiments with racmo2.1 over the greenland ice sheet addressing this issue are in progress. now that racmo2.1 has been fitted with a better albedo parameterization, more accurate estimates of the antarctic mass balance and of the amount of continent - wide produced melt water are possible. for applications to the present climate, satellite observations of areal melt extent can be expanded to a melt volume. running the model for future climate scenarios can give insights to the evolution of snow albedo and the energy budget of the snowpack in coastal regions, and of future meltwater production rates on ice shelves

evidence that increased risk of fuel poverty among older people is a predictor for increased excess winter emergency hospital admissions for respiratory disease. 37 pensioners are likely to spend more time at home than others and are therefore more susceptible to poor thermal conditions where they occur. the british geriatrics society recommends 21 deg c as a suitable indoor temperature for older people. 14 older people are most at risk because they are generally less mobile than others and because the body's thermoregulatory system can deteriorate with age. in the latter case, awareness of temperature extremes is affected, which influences a person's ability to take appropriate avoiding action when the temperature drops. ' cold stress ' exacerbates circulatory disease and results from fluctuations in temperature, 38 such as moving between warm and cold rooms. however, moving from a cold dwelling to the cold outside produces greater cardiovascular strain than going out from a warm house. 39 other groups vulnerable to cold-related illness are the very young and the chronically sick. children are particularly subject to ' wheeze ' in damp conditions, which often occur together with cold. low temperatures will also slow reflexes and affect coordination, especially among older people, and can therefore be the cause of accidents in the home. apart from the recognized physical effects of cold housing on health, mental health problems can arise from the compounded stress of living in debilitating cold and damp conditions. a uk study found that interventions to alleviate fuel poverty, resulting in improved home temperatures and thermal comfort, were significantly associated with improved mental well-being. 40 increasing central heating ownership has been linked with the declining numbers of excess winter deaths over recent decades, but the spread of central heating may not have benefited the most vulnerable groups. 41 after all, central heating ownership does not guarantee that its use can be afforded by householders. research in the uk suggests that increased vulnerability to winter death from cardiovascular disease is linked to indoor temperature and thermal efficiency of housing. 42 other work has shown that lack of central heating is associated with a higher risk of dying in winter but identifies the need to explore further the influence of socio-economic factors and other measures of housing quality. 43 fuel-poor groups in britain appear to be far more vulnerable to dying from cold in winter than those who can afford to heat their houses properly. more free ebooks http://fast-file.blogspot.com"}, {"qas": [{"question": "According to the article,, how long will the polar cap of Mount Kilimanjaro end?", "id": 16854, "answers": [{"text": "the ice cap on mount kilimanjaro may be gone in 20 years", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to the article, what are the consequences of temperature changes?", "id": 16855, "answers": [{"text": "temperature changes are already causing 90% of the world's glaciers to retreat and some to disappear completely, with potentially catastrophic consequences for communities that rely on meltwater for irrigation, hydroelectric power and drinking water, and also communities affected by sea level rises", "answer_start": 352}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many degrees increased in temperature in the Alps since 1970s?", "id": 16856, "answers": [{"text": "in the alps, where summer temperatures have risen by 2.1 deg c since the 1970s", "answer_start": 653}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "this is occurring at an alarming rate, with glaciers on five major continents disappearing rapidly. the ice cap on mount kilimanjaro may be gone in 20 years and the summer of 2003 saw melting of the permafrost levels in many parts of the alps, destabilizing mountain slopes and closing off the matterhorn to visitors for the first time in its history. temperature changes are already causing 90% of the world's glaciers to retreat and some to disappear completely, with potentially catastrophic consequences for communities that rely on meltwater for irrigation, hydroelectric power and drinking water, and also communities affected by sea level rises. in the alps, where summer temperatures have risen by 2.1 deg c since the 1970s, summer flows in glacier-fed rivers have doubled, enabling hydroelectric dams to remain full and power stations to generate at maximum capacity, helping to take up the load slack from the nuclear power stations that, owing to low river flow elsewhere, could not generate at full capacity during the heatwave of 2003 in europe. so there are many other knock-on effects from such melts. in the longer term many glaciers will only survive at the highest altitudes. only scandinavian and alaskan glaciers are not receding, and in some cases are increasing owing to increased snowfall locally, another side effect of climate change. another problem is that because of the higher atmospheric pressure experienced in the alps there is now less snowfall there, resulting in glaciers not being replenished as before. scandinavia, by contrast, is in the path of the changed track of the atlantic depressions, as is britain, resulting in extra rainfall in these countries. in other regions of the world the picture is much worse; the glaciers of central asia are disappearing at a rapid rate, threatening severe future drinking water"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Fill in the blank.

atmospheric circulation change. an apparent inconsistency between the jet and the tracks is found in the subtropical central atlantic where the jet becomes stronger but the number of cyclones decreases. also, mizuta (2012) finds little association in the monthtomonth variability between the observed jet stream speed and the number of strong cyclones over this region. this may suggest that the enhanced baroclinicity associated with the stronger subtropical jet is not available for cyclone development, possibly because it is too far south from the region of highest low-level baroclinicity that sits over the gulf stream. other mechanisms, discussed below, might therefore be important in this region. in jja, the response in the jet stream appears to be well associated with the response in the cyclone tracks. the u250 decreases on the southern flank of the jet stream and increases on the northern flank (see fig. 9d). the pattern is suggestive of a poleward shift and resembles the track density response. a common feature of the djf and jja track density and wind intensity responses is therefore a reduction on the southernmost latitudes with cyclone activity, including the previously discussed subtropical central atlantic area, which has a strengthened jet stream in djf. this common feature is likely associated with the well-known tendency to a broadening

extensive damage to agricultural production and physical assets. with hardly any time to recover, on 15 november 2007 the deadly cyclone sidr, a category iv storm, made landfall across the southern coast of the country, causing over 3000 deaths. the economic damages amounted to over us$1 billion, with over a million tons of rice destroyed. then, the increase in international prices of oil and food, which bangladesh imports, put further strains on both government budgets and household livelihoods. the long-term economic consequences of these three simultaneous shocks remain to be seen, but they have shown the inherent vulnerability of bangladesh to climate risks and the degree to which food security remains a major challenge for the country. with too much water during the heavy monsoon months and too little water during the spring and early summer months, communities have needed to adapt to changing conditions. they have done so by adopting new varieties of crops and new farming practices and by starting small businesses and trades to diversify incomes. furthermore, over the last several decades the government has invested heavily and wisely to protect its citizenry to ensure growth and a prosperous nation. this includes investments in infrastructure, including embankments and cyclone shelters which have saved countless numbers of lives, in early warning systems to help the country prepare for imminent disasters, and polders to protect vital agricultural areas to maintain production to feed its population. the gains from these investments continue to support a growing nation. climate change, however, threatens to offset to some degree these important advances. the prospect of changing temperatures and precipitation patterns, the uncertainty of the timing and magnitude of extreme events, and rising sea levels will have important impacts on the agriculture sector. action is needed today because bangladesh will continue to depend on the agriculture sector for growth and poverty reduction. investments from the public and private sectors will have to increase if bangladesh is to ensure food security for its current and future populations. the challenges that the agriculture sector will face as it adapts to climate change coincide well with the needs required to address the climate variability risks of today. thus, the adaptation options identified are no-regret approaches and only a small example of what is possible. i hope that this report can serve as a useful and meaningful guide for bangladesh (and other countries) in addressing

stocks. firms with sufficient satellite and communications equipment have tried this, and further, during the 1997-98 el nino, firms increased the frequency and length of trips in expectation of

societal benefits (pielke jr. and glantz, 1995). however, as noted, historically typical mandates such as 'to increase societal benefit' may not be specific enough to distinguish among competing conceptions of benefit, some of which would be served by one forecast dissemination strategy and some by others. returning to our example, table i provides one summary of variable conceptions of benefit within the peruvian fishery as observed during this study; note that each group could be broken into subcategories which themselves may have competing goals. thus, overly broad mandates may provide inadequate guidance for choosing between different dissemination strategies. unless it is understood whose welfare contributes to societal benefit, a forecast provider can not even know which dissemination strategies would result in net benefits for society.18"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the cause of increasing uncertainty of effective rainfall in Anantapur and Mahbubnagar?", "id":

a very small percentage of farmers noted observing an increase in unpredictable weather, which suggests that the changes farmers perceive are within the range of variability with which they are familiar. extreme temperature events could have major impacts on the subsistence farming in drought-prone areas such as anantapur. in focus group discussions, farmers reported a reduction in the number of cold days and an increase in number of extreme hot days. they described an increase in the minimum temperature as 'intensity of cold decreasing' and perceived higher temperatures in summer and winter. the record shows that the maximum number of consecutive dry days at anantapur increased over the period from 1965 to 2007. the magnitude of this change was approximately from 80 days in

of global climate change belief and concern on farmers' willingness to adopt mitigation practices was observed in all models (fig. 2). this contrasts with adaptation practices that show a different pattern, whereby local concern for future water availability was the only significant mediator between the independent and dependent variables (fig. 3). among the two types of adaptation practices, only new irrigation practices were significantly affected by local water concerns, which mediated the effect of perceived change in past water availability. adopting new cropping practices such as using a drought tolerant variety of a farmers' current crop or shifting to a less water intensive crop had a lesser likelihood of adoption among farmers (fig. 1), which explains why these practices were not influenced by local and global concerns in our models. these findings provide evidence that the attitudes motivating mitigation versus adaptation behavior tend to be cognitively represented at different construal levels. these results are consistent with psychological experiments conducted by sanna et al. showing that high level construal leads to cooperative environmental behavior (e.g. mitigation practices), while lower level construal generally encourages action to safeguard one's selfinterest (e.g. adaptation) the fact that psychologically distant concerns were a key determinant of mitigation behavior is likely a function of the processing required for one to develop cogent beliefs (or skepticism) regarding the veracity, cause, and solution for global climate change. this suggests that adoption of mitigation practices is motivated more by a farmer's belief in and concern for long-term risks to society at large as opposed to the near-term personal risks, which, by contrast, are one of the goals of adaptation. thus, framing climate change in terms of global impacts and the societal ''gains'' that might be achieved through mitigation can appeal to an individual's desire to contribute to the public good and may yield greater adoption than messages intended to provoke fear of local and/or personal consequences by contrast, adaptation among these farmers is primarily motivated by their concern for local climate impacts, which have low level construal and are by definition psychologically close (table 1). individuals who are operating in a psychologically proximate mindset be they farmers or otherwise will tend to pursue specific goals that they perceive as being both feasible and effective for dealing with problems near at hand past studies also indicate that the adoption of agricultural practices to cope with climate change is strongly influenced by affect and emotion, presumably because affect-driven concerns tend to be construed as psychologically closer to one's personal circumstances [24,31]. for example, when people know from past experience that certain circumstances pose a threat to them, feelings of concern and worry

et al. 2003 ). for example, krause et al. 2002 2003 include the efficiency-improving possibilities documented in the \"5-lab study\" (interlaboratory working group 2000 to arrive at least-cost estimates of the economic costs of emissions reduction. policy assessments typically include savings on energy bills and lower compliance costs, such as the benefits of new energy technologies, but overlook the potential for \"non-energy\" benefits, such as lower maintenance costs, increased production yields, safer work conditions, positive spill-over effects, and economies of scale and scope. these benefits increase the return on energy-related investments; if recognized, firms and consumers may become more willing to adopt or invest in them (finman and laitner 2001 ). these benefits may, in some cases, exceed the associated energy bill savings (worrell et al. 2003 ). the productivity-enhancing effects of investing in these technologies can help offset any drag on the economy imposed by higher fossil-fuel prices. new technologies can stimulate new investment, save consumers money, stimulate productive research and development with spill-over benefits for other sectors and positive multiplier effects, and help to reduce energy imports and increase technology exports. massive public investment in military technology since world war ii led to the widespread adoption of jet aircraft, semi-conductors, and the internet by the private sector and is partly responsible for the technological advantage the us holds globally. in the early 1980s, us companies led the world in wind energy technologies. today, we import those technologies (goodstein 2007 ). as the rest of the world moves forward with climate policy, the us risks losing its technological advantage unless it charts (and funds) a careful and deliberate new technology path. 5 insurance, precaution, and the contribution of climate economics in the three preceding sections, we argued that most iams rely on an analytical framework that privileges immediate, individual consumption over future-oriented concerns; that the benefits, or avoided damages, from climate mitigation are both unpredictable in detail and intrinsically non-monetizable; and that the conventional economic view of technology misrepresents the dynamic, socially determined nature of technical change. not much is left, therefore, of the standard economic approach and its ambitions to perform a complete cost-benefit analysis of climate policy options. in light of these criticisms, how should we think about policy options and the economics of climate change? it should be emphasized that the optimal control approach to climate policy embodied in eq. 1 above is not the only one proposed in the literature. for example, the early growth literature proposed the notion of the \"golden rule\" steady state growth path (solow 1970 ). in this simple model with the savings rate as the only policy variable, optimal growth is the path yielding the highest level of consumption per capita among all sustainable growth paths. sustainable growth, in this context, is a path that does not sacrifice the consumption of future generations by consuming society's capital (including natural capital) for the benefit of the present generation. in such a model, the market rate of interest is equal to the rate of growth of consumption."},

relatively small, however (mueller hellmann 2008 [this issue]). altered climatic constraints on invasive species climate change can lead to the establishment of new invasive species via 3 mechanisms. first, species currently unable to persist in a location because of climatic constraints may be increasingly able to survive and colonize that area (fig. 1; tables 1 2). for example, lee and chown (2007) show that mytilus galloprovincialis an invasive mussel species in south africa, has traveled to antarctica inside storage chests of a support ship for a scientific expedition. presumably, this species has not yet taken hold in antarctica because temperatures are too severe for successful establishment, but warming could increase the probability of establishment. a similar situation exists for plants and animals kept by humans. some of these species inevitably escape (mack 2000) but do not establish because of an unsuitable climate. second, arriving species that can tolerate the climate may have a greater chance of overcoming biotic constraints on their growth and establish persistent populations under climate change. because climate change is expected to shift native species out of the conditions to which they are adapted, competitive resistance from native species may lessen (byers 2002). third, established non-native species could become invasive if climate change increases

further consideration. climatic variability and other natural processes (e.g., fire, floods, insect out breaks) are included in evaluations of ecological variability in the context of ecosys tem
