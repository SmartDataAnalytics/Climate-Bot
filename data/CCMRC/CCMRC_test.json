and authorized purposes as climate changes. changes in climate or other aspects of basin hydrology, as well as changes in social values, may result in new uses for reservoir storage that have a greater economic or social value than the current uses. flood storage space could be evaluated based on updated hydrologic records and future projections. some projects may be operated more efficiently as part of an integrated system rather than as independent projects. updates may be rapid or time consuming and expensive, depending on the river system and the nature and extent of the proposed changes. locations for which observed climate change to date have resulted in a call for operational changes (for example, snowpack-dominated watersheds) may benefit from a systematic revision of reservoir operating plans and drought contingency plans. other locations for which climate change is not a major driver may not require an extensive review or revision. when contemplating the value of incorporating climate projections into reservoir and river operations, managers must weigh potential benefits, given uncertainties in climate information, against the known and immediate costs of revision to operations. on the short term, water managers could increase the adaptive capacity to climate change through increased operational flexibility. one way could be through the use of intraseasonal to interannual climate forecasts. much of the seasonal 5 responding to climate change: adaptation options 2\\\\x18 forecast skill is due to predictions of el nino or la nina and correlated impacts in north america (climate change science program, 2008d). reservoir operators could reduce flood storage during years that are forecast to be dry. in some areas of the country, such

flood. further research needs to be conducted on both developing better forecasts and incorporating the forecasts into reservoir operations. reservoir operations that employ an adaptive management process can have the flexibility to adapt to observed climate conditions on an annual basis. an annual operating plan (aop) is developed based on current hydrologic conditions, the forecast, and likely runoff scenarios (u.s. army corps of engineers, 2004). the draft aop forecasts the regulation of the system for various runoff scenarios and includes public involvement in developing the plan.

scenarios66, notably a collapse of the atlantic thc67-69. the translation into societal impacts typically involves several intervening steps and variables, and underestimation problems arise because studies tend to only consider a subset of consequences or impacted sectors (for example, insurance66). for a collapse of the atlantic thc67,68, the magnitude and even sign of impacts has been contested69, as have questionable extrapolations70 to national security concerns71. such disagreement68-71 is to be expected, as impacts depend on human responses and are thus more epistemologically contested than assigning likelihoods to events72. with these caveats in mind, a 'straw man' tipping-point risk matrix is presented (fig. 5). this illustrates some familiar dilemmas for the would-be risk manager: relatively high-impact low-probability events, such as west african monsoon shift, come out with a similar risk to relatively lower-impact high-probability events, such as arctic summer sea-ice loss. however, what stands out are the high-impact high-probability scenarios as a priority for risk management effort -- in this example, greenland ice-sheet meltdown and west antarctic

doesn't need to do that to see that whatever the earlier scientific-consensus \"messaging\" campaigns added to the mix did not \"clos[e] the consensus gap\" (university of queensland, 2013). why, then, might a reflective, realistic person conclude otherwise--and indeed counsel communicators to spend millions of dollars to repeat exactly that sort of \"messaging\" campaign? the answer could be laboratory studies. one (lewendowsky et al., 2012), published in nature climate change reported that the mean level of agreement with the proposition \"co2 emissions cause climate change\" was higher among subjects exposed to a \"97% scientific consensus\" message than among subjects in a control condition (4.4 vs. 4.0 on a 5-point likert scale). immediately after being advised by the experimenter that \"97% of scientists\" accept co2 emissions increase global temperatures, those subjects also formed a higher estimate of the proportion of scientists who believe that (88% vs. 67%). is it possible to reconcile this result with the real-world data on the failure of previous \"scientific consensus\" messaging campaigns to influence u.s. public opinion? the most straightforward explanation would be that the ncc experiment was not externally valid --i.e., it did not realistically model the real-world dynamics of opinion-formation relevant to the climate change dispute. the problem is not the sample (90 individuals interviewed face-to-face in perth, australia). if researchers were to replicate this result using a u.s. general population sample, the inference of external invalidity would be exactly the same. for \"97% consensus\" messaging experiments to justify a social marketing campaign featuring studies like the erl one, it has to be reasonable to believe that

as shown in figure 4, only one of all possible futures will eventually happen but, as discussed above, this is virtually impossible to predict. a measure of the width of the distribution in figure 4 (e.g. the standard deviation) represents the uncertainty in future climates. this is an \"intrinsic\" uncertainty in the sense that it is not tied to deficiences in the tools used for the climate

mean-preserving increase in the spread of possible damage outcomes increases expected disutility. however, if gross consumption is greater in high-damage scenarios (e.g., because rapid technological advance leads to both high consumption and high emissions rates), then the marginal utility of consumption net of damages is lower, and possibly even lower than marginal utility in lowdamage states. simulations by nordhaus (2008, ch. 7) suggest this might in fact be the case, implying the risk premium is actually negative, though empirically small. finally, we return to the issue of irreversibility and future learning, in particular whether there is an option value (which should be reflected in the current emissions price) gained from delaying atmospheric ghg accumulations until more is known about how much damage they will cause. option values arise if delaying additions to the atmospheric ghg concentration increases the potential welfare gains in the future from responding to new information on the seriousness of global warming. if damages are linear in atmospheric ghg concentrations, which may be a reasonable approximation in the absence of threshold effects, changes in the inherited concentration level do not affect the marginal damage schedule from additional, future accumulations. in this case, the welfare effects of policy interventions at different time periods are decoupled (at least from the damage side), and there is no option value. moreover, to the extent that current abatement involves (nonrecoverable) sunk investments in emissions-saving technologies, there is an option value from delaying long-lived emissions-saving investments until more is known about the benefits of emissions reductions (kolstad 1996a). for these reasons, theoretical analyses suggest that the prospect of future learning justifies less near-term abatement (kolstad 1996b; fisher and narain 2003). however, as already noted, the critical exception to this is when there is a possibility of crossing a catastrophic threshold in atmospheric concentrations prior to future learning, which is essentially nonreversible given the nonnegativity constraint on future emissions (pindyck 2007). 2.2.4. summary most estimates of near-term pigouvian taxes (or marginal damages) are in the order of about $5-25 per ton of co2. this range is in the same ballpark as near-term emissions prices consistent with least-cost stabilization of atmospheric co2 concentrations at 550 ppm. these prices represent a lower bound on appropriate policy stringency. much higher

the biogeographic and climatic position of the recipient country modulates the average number of naturalized plants per import value, with many subtropical and tropical countries receiving by more than an order of magnitude more naturalized plants per unit of import value than boreal and temperate eurasian countries. accounting for temporal changes in trade intensity showed that lag times between increases in trade value and alien species accumulation ('invasion debt') are substantial, although they are shorter than those found in previous studies (essl et al. 2011). the current distribution of naturalized plants reflects past socioeconomic activities, and consequently, recent strong increases in trading activity will cause substantial increases in invasion levels within a few decades, particularly in emerging economies, which show most pronounced growth of naturalized plant numbers compared to countries with similar trade value increases (fig. 6). alarmingly, most of these economies coincide with megadiverse regions (brooks et al. 2006), rich in endemic and rare species. climate change will modify future levels of invasions as the intensity and direction of this interaction strongly depend on the latitudinal position of the focal country. the global trade network has increased enormously since world war ii in terms of the total value of exchanged goods. the technological development of means of transportations (e.g., large-scale transport of goods by airplanes, transcontinental containerships) has decreased the time necessary for intercontinental transport from weeks to days and greatly expanded the type and value of goods (and associated potential alien species) transported. as a consequence, trade has remained the unrivaled cause of the intentional and unintentional of alien species (hulme, 2009). although an increasing number of national and international regulations and import inspections aimed at reducing the unwanted of invasive species have been put in place during the last decades (hulme, 2006), the overall level of propagule pressure associated with trade does not seem to have decreased. due to time lags, the consequences of recently adopted alien species policies aiming to halt the of new alien species may only become discernible after decades. by contributing to the understanding of interactions of global drivers of invasions, such as trade and climate change, and identifying regions that are likely to suffer the greatest risk from plant invasions in the near future, this study provides a foundation for a much improved knowledge of the causes and trajectories of global plant invasions. this is a pivotal prerequisite for the effective management of biological invasions (hulme et al. 2008). the results

processes in sport is achievement goal theory (for recent reviews, see duda hall, 2001; roberts, 2001). achievement goal theory emanates from work in the educational domain, with theorists proposing that individuals' achievement goals are key determinants of motivation-related cognition, affect and behaviour (ames, 1992; dweck, 1999; maehr nicholls, 1980; nicholls, 1984, 1989). these theorists

basis for judging competence and defining success and failure (weiss ferrer-caja, 2002). the contributions of nicholls (1984, 1989) have strongly impacted achievement motivation research in sport. his perspective holds that dispositional goal orientations are central to success and failure assessment in achievement contexts and therefore are key motivational constructs. goal orientations represent tendencies to employ certain conceptions of ability in achievement situations (i.e. goal involvement) and take two forms - namely, task and ego orientation. task orientation is the propensity to

for society, focusing on the uk and northwest europe in particular. the nature of abrupt climate change and the different ways in which it has been defined and perceived are examined. using the example of the collapse of the thermohaline circulation (thc), the suggested implications for society of abrupt climate change are reviewed; previous work has been largely speculative and has generally considered the implications only from economic and ecological perspectives. some observations about the implications from a more social and behavioural science perspective are made. if abrupt climate change simply implies changes in the occurrence or intensity of extreme weather events, or an accelerated unidirectional change in climate, the design of adaptation to climate change can proceed within the existing paradigm, with appropriate adjustments. limits to adaptation in some sectors or regions may be reached, and the costs of appropriate adaptive behaviour may be large, but strategy can develop on the basis of a predicted long-term unidirectional change in climate. it would be more challenging, however, if abrupt climate change implied a directional change in climate, as, for example, may well occur in northwest europe following a collapse of the thc. there are two fundamental problems for society associated with such an outcome: first, the future changes in climate currently being anticipated and prepared for may reverse and, second, the probability of such a scenario occurring remains fundamentally unknown. the implications of both problems for climate policy and for decision making have not been researched. it is premature to argue therefore that abrupt climate change--in the sense referred to here--imposes unacceptable costs on society or the world economy, represents a catastrophic impact of climate change or constitutes a dangerous change in climate that should be avoided at all reasonable cost. we conclude by examining the

unreality until the moment they materialise as symptoms. in other words, without visual presences, the hazards associated with these technologies are difficult to represent as risks. (allan et al. 2000, p. 3) seeing sight is arguably the most dominant of the senses in western culture. however, as barbara adam observes, it is difficult to communicate and validate current environmental risks because 'emphasis is placed on visible materiality at the expense of that which is latent, immanent and hidden from view' (adam, 1998, p. 12). this emphasis on visibility also underpins traditional laws of science by way of linear perspective, the central characteristics of which are 'ion from context, objective observation, quantification of sense data and the single fixed focus all of which associate"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is considered symmetrical?", "id": 5562, "answers": [{"text": "the assumption in a2 that l11 is skew-symmetric", "answer_start": 502}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what else is also considered symmetrical?", "id": 5563, "answers": [{"text": "operator l11 is skew-symmetric", "answer_start": 182}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what kind of behavior is shown?", "id": 5564, "answers": [{"text": "the asymptotic behavior of the climate variables", "answer_start": 293}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "we now turn to the stochastic climate equations in (4.1) and consider first the situation with fast-wave effects but no forcing. the key assumption which we utilize here is that the operator l11 is skew-symmetric so that there is nontrivial averaging on the climate time scales. in this case, the asymptotic behavior of the climate variables for small e is specified by the following: theorem 5.3 denote by xe j( t the solution of the first equation in (4.1) with no fast forcing, f1 j= f 2 j= 0 under the assumption in a2 that l11 is skew-symmetric. in the limit as e - 0 (5.7) "}, {"qas": [{"question": "Name some factors affecting migrant bird population.", "id": 4870, "answers": [{"text": "often observed trends of migrant bird population numbers cannot easily be distinguished from local, site-related factors in and outside the arctic, such as drainage, land-use change, hunting and persecution by humans, as well as predation", "answer_start": 2168}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Are migratory birds outside ot the Arctic breeding grounds being affected?", "id": 4871, "answers": [{"text": "in addition, migratory birds are also heavily impacted by climate change outside the arctic breeding grounds", "answer_start": 2578}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Name an affect of the rising sea level?", "id": 4872, "answers": [{"text": "sea level rise impacts on the extent of coastal staging and wintering grounds will be particularly harmful, and the hunting pressure on wintering waders in certain areas will also reduce bird populations", "answer_start": 2963}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(fig. 7a).

latitude which, at the northern current ranges of the two species, could result in a northern range extension (fig. 7a). in contrast, at the southern edge of the ranges, future warming could not increase growth beyond the genetic capabilities of the species and the dynamics of the species at this part of their ranges would be potentially determined by the responses of competitors to warming. a similar analysis for the moss h. splendens shows how a current alpine population would resemble a population from a lowland forested area under climatic warming (fig. 7b). at the landscape scale, plants are distributed in mosaics associated with microhabitats and the larger-scale latitudinal range changes will be associated with initial changes in landscape mosaics. cushion plants and other species characteristic of wind-exposed patches might become restricted in distribution by increased snow cover. in contrast, plants of snow beds might become more restricted if snow duration decreases. wetland species will become restricted by drying and so on. plants currently restricted to south-facing slopes and warm springs (to some extent analogs of future warmer habitats and hot spots of biodiversity) north of their main distribution areas, can provide \"an inoculum\" for rapid colonization of surrounding habitats when climate becomes warmer, although they themselves are likely to be displaced from their current niches by less diverse shrub-thicket communities. examples include orchids, ferns and herbs in warm springs on west greenland (although orchids and ferns are unlikely to become widely distributed), ericaceous dwarf shrubs in some inner fjords of svalbard and the large shrub/small trees of the north slope of alaska. geographical ranges of animals often

complex-systems epistemology with inherent limitations, often producing managerial governance recommendations and foregrounding material over social drivers of change. further interdisciplinary dialogue with social theory is essential if these frameworks are to become more theoretically robust and capable of informing effective, let alone transformational, climate change governance. to illustrate this potential, ideas from deleuze and guattari ' s political writing as well as other approaches that utilize the notion social fi elds (as opposed to sociosystems) are combined to more fully theorize the origins and enactment of social change. first, the logic of systems is replaced with the contingency of assemblages to reveal how pluralism, not elitism, can produce more ambitious and politicized visions of the future. in particular, this view encourages us to see social and ecological tensions as opportunities for thinking and acting differently rather than as mere technical problems to be solved. secondly, the setting of social fi elds is introduced to situate and explain the power of ideas and the role of agency in times of uncertainty. the potential of such insights is

but the benefit of doing so lies in the fact that this will provide adaptation that legitimates space in development planning, which is essential for mainstreaming adaptive actions. supplementing adaptation with policy and institutional level changes would then make adaptation possible at the municipal level. this is all the more important when considering the fact that most municipalities are already grappling with issues of poor service delivery, insufficient revenue collection and poor financial and human resource capacity. adding more functions, or even reinforcing the functions that municipalities already undertake, with a focus on adaptation would then become a burden. once implemented, there should be proper documenting of the efforts and the impediments and opportunities in

realize that it will not be considered in an equal light to the above normal forecast. this fits with the prospective theory that says that equal risk of loss is more cautiously followed than equal risk of gain. farmers were hesitant to use the forecast that they thought would lead to a poor harvest and were more willing to use the forecast they thought would lead to gain. this is not obvious, as disseminators might have expected people to try and decrease negative impacts and so use the forecast to avoid loss. if farmers did this, it would require an acknowledgement of a potentially poor season, which these farmers did not want to do. other farmers, that are more risk seeking, might respond differently. forecast response options are presented in table 1. these responses have been reassessed in table 2 to classify what the impact of a false forecast would be if the responses had been undertaken. the classification is loose but is determined by asking if the impact would be big or small if the forecasted climate was different to the actual climate. in the case of there being a small impact, this means that farmers might have invested inputs, such as setting up irrigation, but this would not necessarily have a dramatic negative effect. the impact of a false forecast was worse when farmers responded to the forecast for below normal rainfall than when they responded to an above normal forecast. this provides another possible reason for why farmers might have preferred the above normal forecast over the below normal forecast. these findings are important for work on early warning systems, where extremes such as drought are flagged. this research indicates that farmers may be hesitant to respond to extreme warnings. this is where the seasonal forecast could have an advantage over previous warning systems. the forecast is available every year and not just in extreme circumstances. this means that systems will be in place if an emergency situation arises. it

the total months for january 1950-december 2009. top eof modes accounting for 95% of the total variance are used to reconstruct a new anomaly field with reduced observational noise. because this anomaly field still has missing values in the high-latitude southern ocean, the wind stress data of the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep)-national center for atmospheric research (ncar) reanalysis (kalnay et al. 1996) are merged south of 30 8 s by averaging with the reconstructed waswind field. finally, the climatological wind stresses are added to the reconstructed wind stress anomalies. this reconstructed wind stress field effectively excludes unrealistic spatiotemporal outliners. the same reconstruction method with eofs is applied for the waswind zonal and meridional wind fields used in the present study. trend patterns of the interpolated surface wind and wind stress do not change largely from those in the noninterpolated versions."}, {"qas":

planning (e.g., the adaptation policy framework, see box 15) start from the current vulnerability. in many developing countries, adaptation to current threats is the most immediate task to be implemented. the current threats, related to climate variability and other drivers (e.g., policy, markets), are to be addressed before climate change issues can be considered. reducing current vulnerability is essential in the process of adaptation to climate change, because a society less vulnerable to current threats will more likely be adaptive to future changes. the evaluation of

currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. we argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. new techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and dna recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change."},

requires attention. planned adaptation at higher aggregation levels is needed in order to cope with climate change and associated climate variability. this has implications for subsidy, support, and incentive programs. clearly, in the face of climate change, these measures should support the (increasing) diversity of farming systems rather than stimulating large, intensive, and specialized systems. past measures of the common agricultural policy (cap) have mainly supported production and indirectly increased productivity. recent reforms of the cap toward a more sustainable agriculture may positively affect the diversity of farming objectives and management strategies in regions. measures that will give farmers a choice (e.g., between irrigation or no irrigation, to use synthetic or

consider an analysis of the temporal variability (stability) of the performance indicators. how results of this study transfer to other regions needs to be assessed. although the impact of regional farm diversity has not been assessed elsewhere, studies for africa (challinor et al. 2007) and australia (nelson et al. 2005) also showed that farms in less favorable regions are not necessarily more

have argued that a prediction-based paradigm is poorly suited for overcoming the twin physical and social sciences challenges of (1) long-term, regional-scale climate prediction and (2) providing decision-relevant information about potential future climate change within the kinds of stakeholder-focused, participatory processes that lead to better decision making. in contrast, the class of robust decision frameworks offers an opportunity to address these challenges in a way that more fully harnesses knowledge and insights produced by climate science and modeling. in our case studies, we have seen how the use of robust decision frameworks can confer greater credibility, salience, and legitimacy on the types of information typically provided from climate models today. by beginning with bottom-up articulations of management contexts and system vulnerabilities, such processes guide the search for tailored climate information and provide specific questions that can then be asked of models. this promotes greater stakeholder acceptance of model-derived information. in addition, such frameworks allow flexibility in defining relevant climate futures based on the different risk tolerances that different decision-making entities may have. these examples have also illustrated how the use of such frameworks can suggest avenues for new research to improve the quality of climate information--and specifically to quantify the value of this new knowledge for a particular decision. what our examples have also indirectly highlighted, however, is that current applications of robust decision frameworks have not been particularly demanding of climate models. existing archives of basic model outputs such as monthly temperature and precipitation, potentially enhanced with some spatial and temporal downscaling and other kinds of postprocessing, have provided sufficient raw material to meet the needs of these initial forays into robust decision frameworks. extrapolating from these examples, however, suggests new emphases in climate modeling that could increase both the richness of our understanding of climate system behavior and the decision support value of this richer understanding. we suggest that these new emphases fall into the following categories: (1) model applications (2) model structures and complexity (3) technical and technological considerations the view from the perspective of both exploratory modeling and robust decision frameworks implies at least two distinct roles for climate modeling: to help structure the problem by exploring the limits of possible system behaviors; and in the 'scenario generator' role, to help explore the performance of decision options over as wide a range of futures as possible. the first suggests an increased focus on climate model applications like the development of bounding and extreme cases, identification of potential warning signs, and the assessment of relative likelihoods and probable contingencies for future events, including the potential for rapid or accelerating change and threshold crossing in natural and human systems. the second suggests complementary, redoubled efforts to expand the space of climate model formulations and structures, as well as to sample this space more comprehensively. in addition, for most applications we are concerned with coupled systems, such as linked climate and hydrologic systems. we will often not be able to explore the full richness of interactions and behaviors in such systems, nor generate appropriately diverse model formulations (and hence scenarios), without paying attention to issues of model structure and model complexity. for example, the development of the climate response functions for our lake superior case imply some degree of interoperability between climate models and hydrologic models to properly capture important interactions between the two systems. in general, improving climate and impacts model interoperability and integration will help alleviate the problem of developing transfer functions that may fail to represent key system behaviors. extending to better integration with management models (such as weap) will make it easier to address questions of the full, coupled human-natural system, such as those related to unintended consequences of policies and other possible feedbacks from decisions taken, as well as explore non-climatic pressures. as we make our modeling systems more complex, however, we run the risk of succumbing to the"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What can increase the number of landslides?",

is an important part of this balance, and that insufficient transport by eddies allows the thermocline in the models to deepen more than observed in nature; this leads to the subsurface warming drift. as the subtropical gyres deepen, the increased horizontal gradients should enhance mesoscale eddy activity, thereby enhancing the lateral transport of heat away from the gyres and inhibiting further deepening of the gyres and the subsurface warming. we hypothesize that in the absence of sufficient eddy heat transport (whether through explicitly resolved eddies or a parameterization of their effects), the thermocline in the subtropical gyres continues to deepen, implying continued movement of heat from the near-surface layers to the interior thermocline; this will result in the cool bias

and life history strategies among individuals and species are often more consistent. whereas there can be large regional variations in fish diversity (e.g. ormond and roberts, 1997), the relative abundance of fishes in different body size classes is remarkably consistent (bianchi et al., 2000). the slopes of relationships between abundance and body size (size spectra) that include phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish appear to show remarkably little variation among ecosystems despite the highly variable dynamics of component species, suggesting some constancy in the underlying structuring processes (boudreau and dickie, 1992). in exploited fish communities, modelling studies suggest that fishing on higher trophic levels causes the slope of the size spectrum to steepen and the intercept to increase in proportion to fishing effort (gislason and rice, 1998). observational studies suggest that the biomass of species within trophic guilds shows a relative stability that is not apparent in individual species, at least for the heavily exploited georges bank system (duplisea and blanchard, 2005). there is evidence of local reductions in species richness within fish communities due to fishing, and species richness declines with fishing intensity. this has been demonstrated in comparisons between fished and unfished (marine reserve) areas and by comparing species richness across gradients of fishing effort (e.g. gislason, 2003). in low diversity communities, fluctuations in a small number of prey species with limited functional redundancy could have profound effects on energy transfer to higher trophic levels. in other situations where functional redundancy is high, marked shifts in species composition may result in relatively little change in community properties. for example, link and garrison (2002) noticed a shift in the abundance and size composition of fish predators over the last four decades in the georges bank ecosystem, which was attributed

posterior of the model errors (not shown) indicates multidecadal oscillations, which is a general characteristic of the climate system. the autoregressive process of order one for model errors could therefore perhaps be extended to a second-order process, which can exhibit pseudo-periodic behaviour. however, there are not enough data available to justify such an extension, and we do not expect that this would alter the results significantly. to make probable that our simple model can give a reasonable estimate of the climate sensitivity, the model was validated on simulated data from aogcms, on the basis of a much more complex description of the earth's climate, and the results were satisfactory when data for both temperature and ocean heat content were used. the resulting estimate of the climate sensitivity is slightly smaller than the best estimate given in ipcc (2007) and could be compared with other estimates as well. however, we underscore that our results are sensitive to the indirect aerosol effects, which have a large uncertainty. in this study, the cloud-albedo effect is treated as a radiative forcing mechanism in the main part of the study, whereas other indirect aerosol effects will be parts of the climate feedbacks. therefore, the estimate of s presented here is likely to be underestimated because the net forcing of the other indirect effects are likely to be negative (forster et al. 2007). in one of the sensitivity cases, this assumption is further investigated. the results are also influenced by the choice of priors. for instance, using a uniform prior on 1=s moves the posterior of s downwards compared with the posterior based on the uniform prior on s but even if these two priors are very different, they both result in low posterior probabilities for s being less than about 1 or higher than 4 say. the choice of priors will be less important when more data become available. as mentioned in section 1, several authors have estimated the climate sensitivity. these estimates are based either on pure physical modelling through aogcms, on fitting models to reconstructed temperatures from paleoclimate data, or on fitting models to observed temperatures from industrial time as we did. the approach of tomassini et al. (2009) is the one that is most similar to ours. they used a similar climate model mt as ours, included both model errors and observational errors, and fitted their model to both temperature and ocean heat content data, but there are certain differences from our approach. they (i) used only one temperature series; (ii) assumed no autocorrelation in the observational error for temperature; and (iii) did not explicitly model the effect related to the soi. however, the two most important differences are the following:"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what depicts the main map?", "id": 6462, "answers": [{"text": "the main map depicts areas of sea level rise at 1 and 2 meters (dark and light blue, respectively) on a population density map with urban extents delineated", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what make shows the map?", "id": 6463, "answers": [{"text": "it also shows the regions of the each-for study areas in the lower delta", "answer_start": 158}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "why migration may become a necessity for many communities?", "id": 6464, "answers": [{"text": "with projected sea level rise, combined with the possibility of more intense flooding and storm surges, migration may become a necessity for many communities, at least for parts of the year", "answer_start": 1031}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "the main map depicts areas of sea level rise at 1 and 2 meters (dark and light blue, respectively) on a population density map with urban extents delineated. it also shows the regions of the each-for study areas in the lower delta. the ganges delta supported a population of 144 million in 2000, out of which 9.4 million lived in areas that would be inundated by a 2 meter sea level rise. the top left inset map shows those areas most frequently impacted by tropical cyclones. low elevation areas in the southeastern corner of the delta are most affected. the bottom left inset map depicts the area affected by the 2007 flood. the middle inset map shows the distribution of agricultural lands. the delta has 8.5 million ha of agricultural lands, of which 486 thousand ha would be inundated by a 2 meter sea level rise. in the ganges delta, living with varying water levels is a way of life. migration, particularly towards coastal urban centers, has emerged as a coping mechanism when extreme events endanger life and livelihoods. with projected sea level rise, combined with the possibility of more intense flooding and storm surges, migration may become a necessity for many communities, at least for parts of the year."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Explain Kyoto protocol (1997) on GHG?

based on distribution of caloric consumption as changes in the average dietary energy consumption under climate change are negligible, while changes in malnutrition prevalence and headcount are substantial. our analysis of the individual drivers of global food security shows that from 1991 to 2001, population and tfp were the dominant drivers of malnutrition count. at the global level, the

class distribution (three factors determined by the amount and type of fuels present) accounted for an estimated 66% of the increase in flame length in savanna, relative to forest (fig. 6). similarly, these three factors accounted for 57% and 58% of the increased rate of spread and fireline intensity, respectively. discussion our results reveal that the higher flammability of savanna, relative to forest, can be attributed largely to the presence of grasses, rather than to the hotter, drier and windier microclimate. grasses had this effect because they produce a fuel bed with low bulk density (fig. 4a), which, in turn, was the parameter that most strongly contributed to the faster and more intense fires in savanna (fig. 6). although the importance of fuel bulk density at the savanna-forest

extends the distance over which the fire pre-heats the fuels, thereby increasing the rate of fire spread by bringing a greater area of unburned fuels close to the temperature of combustion. grasses

layer ocean and thermodynamic/dynamic model of sea ice. the computational expense of this calculation has been reduced by two means. firstly, the atmospheric component involves a relatively lowresolution nine-level and approximately 4.5 by 7.5  grid spacing. secondly, the variations in orbital geometry have been accelerated by a factor of 30 which is consistent with the relatively short equilibration time of the atmosphere-slab ocean system which is on the order of 10 years, or more than three orders of magnitude faster than the most rapidly varying component of orbital forcing. these economies allowed the experiment to be completed within a 5500-model-year integration. the response of the model to orbital forcing is overwhelming linear with the exception of sea-ice thickness. the dominantly linear response permitted the mathematical separation of the effects of precession from the effects of obliquity that greatly enhanced the ability to interpret model predictions in terms of changes in the seasonal and annual mean insolation. the orbital configuration that was found to be most glaciation-friendly occurs when obliquity is low and aphelion occurs is in late spring through the combined influence a reduced potential-ablation and enhanced snowfall. the climate model simulates prominent minima in potential-ablation at 26, 73, and 117 ka and secondary minima at 97 and 142 ka that coincide within a few thousand years to the maxima and secondary maxima in snowfall. these time intervals correspond to phases of falling sea level and terrestrial ice growth as indicated by the marine d18o record. we track the thermal and dynamical processes affecting potential ablation and snowfall through the influence of orbital forcing on surface air temperature. in particular we noted that obliquity and precession affect the seasonal and annual mean climate within the arctic similarly, largely because of feedbacks and properties of sea ice. an enhanced meridional temperature gradient during late fall and early winter provided mainly by the response of sea ice but also because of cloud feedbacks at low latitudes and a reduction in the poleward heat transports by stationary waves all contribute to the increase in storm activity that correlates with the time intervals of enhanced snowfall. the exact timing of the maxima in snowfall can be affected by zonal asymmetries in the model climate created in part by the atmosphere stationary wave response to orbital forcing. the fact that orbital forcing leads to increases in snowfall during the same time intervals as when potential ablation is minimized is one of the most significant conclusions of the present modeling exercise. this would imply that the connection between orbital forcing and glacial and interglacial cycles is much more intimately involved in the sometimes complex internal processing of the climate system than might be assumed if the amount of terrestrial ice is primarily a function of local changes in insolation as is often assumed."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does the GEOS-5 assimilation system include?", "id": 12324, "answers": [{"text": "the geos-5

impact of climate on growth. however, we could not find significant differences of douglas-fir occurrences among regions with respect to a topographic convergence index as proxy for soil moisture

heatstrokes in cities in developing countries as a result of the so-called heat island eff ect. rising temperatures will also aff ect the spread and transmission rates of vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases. temperature aff ects rate of pathogen maturation and replication within mosquitoes, the density of insects in a particular area, and increases the likelihood of infection. therefore, some populations who have little or no immunity to new infections might be at increased risk. vector reproduction, parasite development cycle, and bite frequency generally rise with temperature; therefore, malaria, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue fever will become increasingly widespread. in some cases, extreme events, such as heavy rains, will wash away eggs and larvae and decrease vector populations. mosquitoes responsible for malaria will grow, by accessing warm high altitudes, in places once free of the disease.36 lindsay and martens37 have used models and scenarios to estimate that

fast wave modes is comparable to that in the slow balanced modes. the study by warn (1986), in the 12 context of the shallow water equations, essentially confirms that qg flows are not equilibrium states, and that a substantial part of the energy may end up in the fast (surface) wave modes at statistical equilibrium, implying a direct cascade of energy to the small scales. bartello (1995) has obtained analytically the equilibrium energy spectrum for the boussinesq equations (neglecting the nonlinear part of potential vorticity), in the presence of rotation, confirming the direct cascade of energy. in particular, there is no negative temperature states in this case, due to the presence of the inertia-gravity waves. in fact, numerical simulations pouquet and marino 2013) indicate that turbulence with rotation and stratification might have at the same time an inverse and a direct cascade of energy. a natural interpretation would be that vortical modes are responsible for the inverse cascade while waves cascade energy downscale simultaneously. bartello (1995) had discussed the possibility of a wavevortical mode decoupling on the basis of resonant triadic interactions. without any assumptions on the dynamics, another interpretation in the statistical mechanics framework uses an analogy with metastable states: restricting the equilibrium probability distribution to the slow

companies unquestioningly assumed a face value of these investments based on the short-term costs of selling and buying them on a rising bull market. well into 2007 markets were awash with cheap money apparently indiscriminately available to individuals and institutions alike to keep buying, selling, leasing and renting these assets for whatever they could get for them or get them for, in line with the market models and drivers taught relentlessly in business schools around the world. buildings ceased to be seen as much-loved homes or well-liked and respected foundation stones for durable businesses, but rather as commodities that could be traded on eventually for profit. the problem was that too little attention was paid to the durability of them as investments or their actual shelf-lives. durabilit e is the french term for sustainability and it is a very good word. investors too often had a disastrously unrealistic understanding of the economic sustainability of the assets they were happy to pay so much money for. very often it was not their own money and frequently decision-making individuals would be financially rewarded for the value of the portfolios they were trading in and were not accountable for losses incurred as a result of such decisions. sound familiar? so what is the problem? the problem is that many of these buildings are ' investment nightmares ' in the 2003 manuscript for the first edition of this book, published in early 2005, the poor quality of many modern buildings was pointed out. many modern office blocks are built without proper walls, as described in the building regulations. these require that walls should have a ' transmittance ' to heat (or u-value) of around 0.25. many of the glass-box buildings in cities have double-glazed envelopes with 10 times that u-value. increasingly in such buildings the bulk of the construction costs are used not on the fabric of the building, its walls, floors, windows, mass and insulation to protect and shelter occupants, but on machines to deal with the problem of overheating and cooling created by putting people into buildings that are little more than glass boxes with fixed windows.

from the 2001 national land cover database (nlcd) map (25) for the original base map. this produced a set of land-use targets similar to those in the restoration plan for the year 2025 for each land use scenario (current, moderate restoration, and full restoration) for habitat variables that affect habitat capacity and salmon survival si table 3 ). because the land cover targets in the restoration plan were specified for 11 subbasin groups (11), but the hydrologic model required spatially explicit maps as input, we developed a land-cover allocation model to translate the targets for each restoration scenario into land-cover maps. the model had two components: an urban-growth model and a forest-conversion model. in arcgis spatial analyst (esri, redlands, ca), we developed raster-based cost-distance models, which calculated land conversion probability for each grid cell by weighting its distance from a source by its conversion cost, for urban growth and forest conversion. for the urban growth model, conversion costs for each land-cover type were calculated from the proportion of that type converted to urban areas between 1995 and 2001, as calculated from nlcd maps si table 4 ). costs were further weighted by slope, with steeper slopes less likely to be converted. for the forest-conversion model, conversion costs were calculated from slope and distance from a source. current urban areas were used as the source for urban growth and clear-cuts for forest conversion. protected areas and wetlands were masked out of all analyses, leaving land cover in these areas unchanged. we first ran the urban-growth model until urban-cover targets si table 3 were met. we then ran the forest-cover model, masking the new urban areas, and merged the results of the two models. we used a habitat capacity model, described in ref. 11, to estimate the effects of changes in riparian forest cover, off-channel habitat, stream-edge habitat, and in-stream barrier removal on habitat capacity for juvenile salmon rearing. adult spawning capacity calculations relied on a similar model based on stream width, gradient, and riparian condition and did not vary among scenarios

mediate climatic influence on the subordinate species. models were parameterized using data from populations on the south coast of southwest england and verified by hindcasting using independent north coast population data. recruitment of the dominant competitor, s. balanoides is driven by temperature. the mechanisms of competition explored included simple space preemption and temperature-driven interference competition. the results indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile barnacles is important in regulating chthamalid density but not that of the dominant competitor s. balanoides simulations were carried out using alternative future climate scenarios to predict barnacle population abundance over the next century. under all emission scenarios, the cold-water s. balanoides is predicted to virtually disappear from southwest england by the 2050s, leading to the competitive release of chthamalus throughout the entire region and thereby substantially increasing

the direct effects of temperature on survival, and also by altering important negative interactions through shifting competitive balances and essentially removing dominant competitors or predators.

parker, 2000). a number of studies and reports discussed in this paper refer to flood disasters of different scales, and statistics on flood disaster provide a useful indicator for global flood risk. the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters (cred) manages a global database on disaster impacts. cred classifies an event as a disaster if at least one of the following has occurred: 10 or more people killed; 100 or more people reported affected; a call for international assistance; and/or a declaration of a state of emergency. according to their disaster data, floods come second only to drought/famine in recent years in causing direct mortality (as defined), and account for more than half of all people 'affected' by natural disasters. since 'people affected are those requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency, i.e., requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and medical assistance' (ifrc, 2003, p180), this measure provides an indication of the scale of health impact associated with flooding. though they have a number of limitations regarding the quality of information (see chapter 3), disaster statistics also provide some indication of the geography of flood risk to human populations. tables 2.2 and 2.3 compare flood and wind storm disaster statistics for different continents using the em-dat data from cred (many of the deaths attributed to wind storms are flood-related). from the tables, it is clear that flood disasters and their mortality impacts are heavily skewed toward asia, where there are high population concentrations in floodplains of major rivers, such as the gangesbrahmaputra, mekong and yangtze basins, and in cyclone-prone coastal regions such as around the bay of bengal and the south china sea. closer analysis of the statistics suggests that developing countries in general bear a disproportionate toll - with industrialised or 'high human development' countries accounting for

modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. the biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. the identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via campesino a campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. the effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change. keywords agroecology climate change resilience adaptive capacity"}, {"qas":

an individual's core values; however, psychological closeness should encourage a person to act, given his or her improved ability to focus on the consequences of the actions. interestingly, recent experimental research by rabinovich et al. has indicated that a combination of both an abstract mindset and specific goals (or a specific mindset and goals) may be most useful in promoting

focus of clt is clearly on how an mindset encourages behavior in line with ideals whilst goal setting theory focuses on the best way of translating intentions into action. here, we will explore the relationship between naturally arising perceptions of distance and preparedness to act to mitigate climate change and, in doing so, will consider the validity of each of these hypotheses in this domain. 1.3. the psychological distance of climate change there is currently quite limited evidence examining clt and psychological distance within the domain of climate change; however, there is a variety of disparate evidence that speaks to these issues. polling evidence indicates that people generally perceive climate change as most likely to impact geographically and temporally distant people and places.(12)in addition, climate change impacts tend to be viewed as more serious for distant locations.(35)people also clearly distinguish between personal and societal impacts of climate change, with several studies finding that personal risks of climate change are judged to be lower than societal risks.(12 35)note that these results are found within respondents in britain and the united states and that this may well be culturally bounded. indeed, the perception that climate change impacts may be more serious in developing countries, particularly those located in the geographic south may be quite accurate,(36)and importantly, these are also likely to be the countries who do not have the resources and capability to deal with these impacts. in fact, whilst cross-national studies do indicate that respondents from developing countries tend to be more concerned about local environmental issues than those from industrialized nations,(37 38)beyond this a general spatial

project were used. according to the median climatic evolution, aletschgletscher was expected to lose 90% of its ice volume by the end of 2100. even when the model was driven using current climate conditions (the past two decades) the glacier tongue experienced a considerable retreat of 6 km, indicating its strong disequilibrium with the present climate. by including a model for the evolution

change can be reduced by mitigation policies, in which the ecosystem service of carbon sequestration has a role to play (see box 5). however, local practices of carbon sequestration will not have a

reflected in research conducted over the past five years. the discipline has evolved significantly, as researchers from a wide range of disciplines have become increasingly involved. enhanced interest reflects the growing realization that, even with effective mitigation measures, some degree of climate change is inevitable. impacts are no longer viewed as hypothetical outcomes, but as risks that need to be addressed through adaptation. indeed, as emphasized in the third assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, adaptation is a necessary complement to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in addressing climate change at all scales. adaptation to climate change represents a challenge to all countries of the world, including canada. although climate change may be unique in its scope and the potential magnitude of its impacts, humans have always adapted to changes in their environment, both climatic and non-climatic, so there is a foundation of knowledge upon which to build. the purpose of adaptation is not to preserve the status quo, since that will simply not be possible for most ecosystems and many human systems. rather, the goal of adaptation is to reduce the negative impacts of climate change, while taking advantage of new opportunities that may be presented. since there will always be uncertainties associated with climate change, the issue is best addressed in the context of risk management. an important shift over the past 5 to 10 years has been the growing recognition of the importance of considering social, economic and political factors, in addition to biological and physical ecosystem factors, in impacts and adaptation studies. for instance, preliminary studies have been conducted into the costs of both potential impacts and various adaptation options. there has also been increasing use of the concept of vulnerability in impacts and adaptation research. vulnerability refers to the degree to which a system, region or sector is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, the effects of climate change and climate variability. research focused on vulnerability emphasizes the need to develop a strong understanding of the current state of the system being studied by involving stakeholders and taking an integrative, multidisciplinary approach. through consideration of current vulnerability, along with scenarios of future climate, social and economic conditions, it is possible to estimate future vulnerabilities in the context of risk management. continued improvements in climate modelling and scenario development are important for impacts and adaptation research. likewise, improved understanding of how adaptation occurs, and what barriers exist to successful adaptation, is extremely important. the

conclusions relevant to policy processes can be drawn. first, city-scale vulnerabilities are likely to be greater in tdeveloping country cities, primarily reflecting the fact that the population of these cities is often growing faster than their physical infrastructure capacity, and that their existing adaptation deficit to current climate variability as well as future exposure to climate change is greater than in developed countries. most adaptive action to date has focused on awareness-raising, though progress in mega-cities such as london and new york suggests that climate change impacts can also be more formally incorporated into current planning and decision-making as long as there exists the institutional structure and coordination capacity. the existing mega-city studies show that establishment of a designated lead organisation or unit within an organisation is an effective means of co-ordinating initial scoping 6 activities, and that engagement with key sectoral stakeholders is essential if the benefits of these initial activities are to be maximised. we therefore suggest in the conclusions to this paper that with limited resources, future research effort might focus on a number of scoping case studies using common methods - possibly on a global pooled funding basis that allow other cities to explore the potential for transfer of results between cities with similar location or vulnerability characteristics. subsequent studies may be then taken where there are specific vulnerabilities and where the initial studies identify impacts that justify quantitative analysis to inform current investment and development decisions and strategies. clearly, whilst sea level rise and extreme weather events are obvious initial research areas, the lack of evidence cautions against a focus on these two categories alone. this is particularly important in moving from a generic assessment of the prioritised physical impacts, to a quantified analysis of the monetary damages. the issue of energy tdemand (particularly in existing warmer cities), is shown here to be potentially very significant, especially in economic terms, and this should also be a priority. additional impacts on health and water scarcity also warrant further investigation, together with a large number of associated cross-sectoral impacts that may be identified from taking a spatiallydefined assessment such as this.t"}, {"qas": [{"question": "HOW MANY YEARS MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH?", "id": 19438, "answers": [{"text": "one hundred years ago", "answer_start": 0}],

imaginative and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. it is a hegemony which lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of

distributed around the world. certain countries, regions and areas are more vulnerable than others because of their geographic location, climate, geology and their capacity to cope with extreme conditions. developing countries are particularly affected by climate change because climate-sensitive sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, tend to be very important from an economic standpoint and because they have limited human, institutional and financial capacity to anticipate and respond to the effects of climate change (ipcc, 2001 ). climate-related hazards and climate change affect a wide range of ecological systems, including forests, grasslands, wetlands, rivers, lakes and marine environments, and human systems, including agriculture, water resources, coastal resources, health, financial institutions and settlements (ipcc, 2001 ). complex interactions of social, economic and environmental factors operating on different spatial and temporal scales give rise to vulnerability as they affect the ability of individuals and communities to prepare for, cope with, and recover from, disasters. population density and growth, unplanned urbanisation, inappropriate land use, environmental mismanagement and loss of biodiversity, social injustice, poverty and short-term economic vision are important determinants of vulnerability (isdr, 2002 for an earlier statement on social vulnerability, see bohle et al., 1994 ). many poor and marginalised people are directly dependent on ecosystem services for their livelihood activities and are therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions and factors that may limit their access to such resources (task force on climate change, vulnerable communities and adaptation, 2003 ). in addition to access to natural resources, people's vulnerability to climate-related hazards is determined by their access to social and financial resources, information and technology, as well as by the effectiveness of institutions. those most vulnerable to natural hazards tend to be particular social groups (including women, the elderly, children, ethnic and religious minorities, single-headed households), people engaged in marginal livelihoods, socially excluded groups (such as 'illegal' settlers and others whose rights and claims to resources are not officially recognised) and those with inadequate access to economic (credit, welfare) and social (networks, information, relationships) capital. so far, many efforts by both communities have concentrated on reducing the vulnerability of specific sectors to a particular hazard at the local scale. disaster risk management addresses some important scale processes by sharing the burden of disaster impacts through insurance mechanisms (mechler and pflug, 2002 ). climate change adaptation has largely focused on how individual actors and sectors may be able to adapt to shifting environmental conditions (for example, change of crops) rather than tackling the wider structural constraints that determine vulnerability. recent research on the causal structures of current patterns of human vulnerability to environmental change (kasperson and kasperson, 2001

living standards and compete over limited resources, and the strong evidence that continuing use of fossil fuels without measures to reduce co2 emissions may lead to irreversible environmental damage resulting from global warming. the problem is particularly daunting because of the scale of energy consumption and its positive time derivative, and the global nature of the problem and proposed solutions. while we witness growing competition over limited resources, there is a need for global cooperation to formulate and implement solutions for harnessing more resources and mitigating the negative impacts of energy consumption. to match the consumption scale and universal impact, a portfolio of approaches that adopt to local conditions must be implemented. solutions must be endorsed and implemented globally. solutions must be technically grounded and rely on existing technologies or technologies under development. in to succeed in achieving largescale change in a timely fashion,

gap-models have yet to be subjected to the full range of testing these methods, especially with respect to mortality (botkin, 1993; shugart and west, 1980). comparative analyses of different gap-model formulations are now being actively pursued (yaussy, 2000). however, validation of models by comparison with real data on stand composition and structure is needed. dahlman (1985) noted that gap models are potentially powerful tools for simulating community-level responses to co2 increase, but only if properly parameterized and validated. otherwise, they are just exploratory exercises. there is the question whether appropriate mortality data are available or can ever be collected to extensively validate the representation of plant death in gap models, especially spatial gap models. many gap models are validated by initializing the model with historical data and then the model is run to the present to compare outputs with contemporary conditions. unfortunately, there are probably very few historical validation data sets that can be used to test the predictive power of gap models because of the compounding errors of sampling, synthesis, and extrapolation (deutschman et al., 1999). an alternative is to validate model components, such as mortality, separately using appropriate data sets that have been tested for accuracy. this will require an extensive database of field observations documenting the conditions of plant death mentioned above, which will be costly and difficult to compile. another option is to simulate the error in input data from the output predictions to create response surfaces for model mortality parameters and evaluate if the surface contains sampled reference conditions. a comprehensive sensitivity analysis can also provide ad hoc validation of many model components in lieu of readily available comparison data (van der voet and mohren, 1994). 5. conclusions climate change will probably render the generalized treatment of plant mortality in gap models ineffectual. but, we conclude that the current treatment of mortality in gap models is probably the best that can be done given the lack of comprehensive data linking mortality to physiological and environmental conditions. because the assumptions behind current mortality algorithms will not necessarily be applicable under changing climates, these algorithms must be improved based on extensive new field data to more accurately simulate the interactions of ecosystem processes and climates on mortality. listed below are some other general recommendations."}, {"qas":

rasid (2000), who showed that a majority of floodplain residents - mainly farmers - prefer regulated flood levels instead of total flood prevention, where the preferred level of inundation corresponds with the ideal flood depth for the cultivation of floodplain rice. from the key informant interviews, it appears that the existence of social networks or an institutional set-up in the area for a more collective ex ante or ex post coping strategy to flooding is very thin. moreover, no differences between villages in this poor and severely flood struck can be detected in terms of formal or informal institutional arrangements to cope with flood hazards within the community9. flood affected poor families are allowed to take shelter in village schools or higher local government buildings, where they can stay as long as the area remains flooded (weeks/months). families who lose their home and livelihood and remain without savings or other sources of income can move to flood relief camps in the district (upazilla) headquarters, which are usually set up and managed by local government. most of the flood-affected people barely have any savings or food stocks. based on the 2004 regional flood report (lcg bangladesh, 2004), it was estimated that flood affected floodplain residents required food-aid for between 150 to 180 days as they did not have any possibilities of income generation until the next harvesting season. also the existence of formal credit institutions to help rehabilitate flood struck households in the study area is rare. flood affected families mainly cope with a flood crisis with the help of informal credit. relatives, neighbours and family friends help flood affected families by providing loans and other assistance, or flood affected families buy food from local shops on a credit basis. sometimes richer, well-off families in a village lend money to flood affected local residents. a number of leading non-government organizations (ngos) that mainly deal

possibility, demonstrated using ebms, that a bias in the temperature change in the future related to a particular forcing agent may be empirically related to the bias in the past change associated with that forcing agent by a scaling factor (fig. 3). the method computes a correction factor or recalibration of simulated past changes that can be used to scale future projections assuming that the empirical relationship continues to hold. the uncertain elements of the approach are the scaling factor and the component of past change related to a forcing agent. in the global mean temperature case, the scaling factor may be relatively well constrained (fig. 3b). the difficult parameter to assess is the past change that can be associated with a particular anthropogenic component such as carbon dioxide, as represented by the histogram on the x axis in fig. 3. the observed record of global and large-scale temperature change is made of components forced by anthropogenic factors such as greenhouse gas and aerosols, external factors such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions and internally generated natural variability. detection and attribution techniques seek to estimate these individual components of trends from the observed record, using complex climate model simulations in combination with regression techniques. uncertainties arise because the responses to some forcing agents may correlate through time (for example, concurrent rises in greenhouse gases and aerosols) making it hard to estimate the regression coefficients, because of uncertainties in reconstructing past forcing agents, and because of potential errors in the complex model response to the forcing. the ask technique can therefore be thought of as generating an ensemble of future projections by sampling a large number of possible past trends that are attributable to a particular forcing agent. the parameters of the relationship between the past and the future and the attributable warming are constrained by observations and complex model studies and thus the projections are also constrained by those observations. by specifying the components of the radiative forcing separately, it is possible to make projections for combinations of radiative forcing that may occur in the future but that did not occur in the past. initial studies focused on global mean temperatures27 but have been extended to constrain continental-scale temperature changes25. the strengths of the approach are in the simplicity of the idea of extrapolating uncertainties in past trends. the complexity arises in the need to separate the components of the observed trends into those associated with greenhouse gases, aerosols, natural forcing factors and internal climate variability. for global mean projections, this separation is the largest source of uncertainty26. for regional quantities, relationships between past and future trends may be weak and for some variables and for smaller-scale regions, such relationships may not be evident in the complex models used in the detection and attribution step. in the example highlighted here, a simple ebm is used to obtain the relationship between past warming and future change, hence it is tempting to conclude that the projections only quantify the uncertainty in the forced response. however, the estimate of the warming attributable to greenhouse gases is contaminated with natural variability (as we only have one realization of the real world) so some account is taken of the random component. limitations on computer resource also mean that results are often obtained from initial-condition ensembles from a small number of different climate models. hence there is a potential for modelling uncertainties to be undersampled."}, {"qas": [{"question":

in foliar metabolism that shifts from assimilation to the remobilization of resources, as shown by the dynamics of the transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of foliar cells. the onset of leaf senescence, the tipping point in the transition from anabolism to catabolism, manifests before the mentioned external signals are visible. the onset begins with the down-regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and with the up-regulation of genes associated with senescence (breeze et al. 2011; guo, 2013). by the end of the process of leaf senescence, a large fraction of the mobile nutrients have been transferred to the perennating organs. the recovery of nutrients is a complex challenge given the variety of nutrient-containing molecules and the compartmentalization in

extratropical sst variability remains poorly understood (frankignoul 1985; kushnir et al. 2002). this has undermined our understanding of ocean-atmosphere feedback in the extratropics and, in turn, its role in interdecadal variability. the study of the atmospheric response to extratropical sst has been challenging in both observations and modeling. the atmospheric response to extratropical sst anomalies is difficult to assess from observations alone because of the overwhelming climate noise of atmospheric internal variability. modeling the atmospheric response to extratropical sst

(2001) that the methodology used to construct vulnerability indicators be transparent and understandable. in a case such as this, where the consensual knowledge base is limited, taking care in perceiving and defining the problem becomes all the more important and should be an iterative, participatory and ongoing process (bell and morse 1999). the sources of diversity in study approaches evident in table ii can be summarized in terms of a crude typography, inclusive/comprehensive as opposed to selective/limited in terms of the number of variables employed. this typography does, however, mask a more philosophical distinction between those studies basing the selection of indicators on some theoretical understanding of the factors determining levels of vulnerability and those adopting a more empirical, evidence-driven approach. thus, two different approaches have been used in selecting vulnerability indicators: one based on a theoretical understanding of relationships and the other based on statistical relationships. in his review of national environmental indicators, niemeijer (2002) makes a broad distinction between the parallel theory-driven approach, where the best possible indicators are selected from a theoretical point of view, and a data-driven approach. the first represents a deductive research approach and the second an inductive research approach.

predicted to expand the distribution of vector-borne diseases there are two reasons for this: abundances of most vectors are positively related to temperature and for most vector-borne diseases, transmission may be enhanced by higher ambient temperature. the development of plasmodium for example, can occur between 16-30 u c, with optimal temperatures around 28- 30 u c, whereas temperatures lower than 16 u c greatly inhibit parasite development in contrast to predictions for vector borne parasites, many studies have reported reductions in geographical range size and abundance, and shifts to lower latitudes or high altitudes, in a wide range of organisms that are potential hosts for these parasites [8- 11]. range expansion of vector borne parasites may increase their prevalence in many host populations. increased parasite loads can have negative effects on host populations, reducing growth and causing higher mortality and/or lower birth rates [12-15]. these effects could amplify the risk of extinction for many already threatened species. the study of parasite distributions in relation to climate gradients is important in helping us to understand how host species might be affected by changing parasite prevalence under climate change. elevational gradients provide an excellent framework for such research, because temperature is closely"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why were the

tracks play a major role in regulating the precipitation and hydrological cycle in midlatitudes. the changes in the location and amplitude of the storm tracks in response to global warming will have significant impacts on the poleward transport of heat, momentum and moisture and on the hydrological cycle. recent studies have indicated a poleward shift of the storm tracks and the midlatitude precipitation zone in the warming world that will lead to subtropical drying and higher latitude moistening. this study agrees with this key feature for not only the annual mean but also different seasons and for the zonal mean as well as horizontal structures based on the analysis of geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory (gfdl) cm2.1 model simulations. further analyses show that the meridional sensible and latent heat fluxes associated with the storm tracks shift poleward and intensify in both boreal summer and winter in the late twenty-first century (years 2081-2100) relative to the latter half of the twentieth century (years 1961-2000). the maximum dry eady growth rate is examined to determine the effect of global warming on the time mean state and associated available potential energy for transient growth. the trend in maximum eady growth rate is generally consistent with the poleward shift and intensification of the storm tracks in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres in both seasons. however, in the lower troposphere in northern winter, increased meridional eddy transfer within the storm tracks is more associated with increased eddy velocity, stronger correlation between eddy velocity and eddy moist static energy, and longer eddy length scale. the changing characteristics of baroclinic instability are, therefore, needed to explain the storm track response as climate warms. diagnosis of the latitude-by-latitude energy budget for the current and future climate demonstrates how the coupling between radiative and surface heat fluxes and eddy heat and moisture transport influences the midlatitude storm track response to global warming. through radiative forcing by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, more energy is gained within the tropics and subtropics, while in the middle and high latitudes energy is reduced through increased outgoing terrestrial radiation in the northern hemisphere and increased ocean heat uptake in the southern hemisphere. this enhanced energy imbalance in the future climate requires larger atmospheric energy transports in the midlatitudes which are partially accomplished by intensified storm tracks. finally a sequence of cause and effect for the storm track response in the warming world is proposed that combines energy budget constraints with baroclinic instability theory. keywords storm tracks  global

and size of glacial lakes forming at the new terminal ends behind the exposed end moraines. these in turn give rise to an increase in the potential threat of glacial lake outburst floods occurring. such disasters often cross boundaries; the water from a lake in one country threatens the lives and properties of people in another. regional cooperation is needed to formulate a coordinated strategy to deal effectively both with the risk of outburst floods and with water management issues. the international centre for integrated mountain development (icimod) in partnership with unep and the asia pacific network and in close collaboration with national partner organisations documented baseline information on the himalayan glaciers, glacial lakes, and glofs in an earlier study which identified some 200 potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the himalayas. the study published here builds upon these past initiatives and investigates the impact of climate change on selected glaciers and glacial lakes. the publication provides an account of glacier retreat and growth of glacial lakes in two selected river sub-basins, one in nepal and one in bhutan. it describes important methodological aspects of assessing the vulnerability for glof hazards based on empirical data and evidence. it also investigates the possibility of devising a method for regular temporal monitoring of glacial lakes in remote and inaccessible mountain locations using satellite-based techniques. the results provide a basis for the development of monitoring and early warning systems and planning and prioritisation of disaster mitigation efforts that could save many lives. the report also provides useful information for those concerned with water resources and environmental planning. this report is also being packaged in a multi-media cd-rom with films, 3-d visualisation photographs, and satellite images. the report and multimedia product will be useful for scientists, planners, and decision makers, as well as for raising the awareness of the public at large to the potential impacts of climate change in the himalayas. with this information, we hope to contribute to improving the lives of mountain people and help safeguard future investments in the region. it highlights the need to replicate, refine, and scale up such studies, using scientific approaches and empirical evidence, in other parts of the himalayan region. we are convinced that it will increase the awareness of the readers of the need to support initiatives. vi icimod is grateful to the united nations

characteristics of hourly rainfall in the 1.5and 12-km rcms. although there is considerable overlap between the radar and the model data period, model data are not available for all 8 years of the radar periiod. specifically the model data span 1989-2008 and, owing to highresolution sst data only currently being available until the end of 2008, it has not been possible to extend the run further. we note, however, that, due to the large size of the 12-km-rcm domain and that observational constraints are only fed in at the lateral and sea surface boundaries, we would not expect the day-to-day series of weather patterns over the united kingdom in the models to exactly correspond to those in reality even for the same set of years. in this study we are assessing the climatology of hourly rainfall accumulated over several years, which is not expected to vary greatly from one decade to the next. to confirm this, we compare rainfall characteristics in the radar with those in the models for two separate 8-yr model periods (1990-97 and 2000-07). we also only show differences that are significant compared to year-to-year variability (see section 2c). there are many issues with radar data. it can be affected by clutter (e.g., phone masts in the way of the beam), deflection of the beam onto the ground (anomalous propagation), increased signal at the melting level (bright band), assumptions in the conversion of reflectivity to rain/snow rate, evaporation below the beam, and attenuation that may lead to systematic underestimation of heavy rain. it is also less reliable in mountainous areas because the lower-elevation beams may be blocked and unusable and more assumptions then have to be made. all of these effects can lead to errors or biases in the measurement of precipitation amounts. the met office calibrates against rain gauges and employs algorithms to take account of the above when producing a u.k. radar composite (harrison et al. 2000), but the quality control is difficult and some problems cannot be fully rectified. nevertheless, radar is still particularly useful for capturing the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of precipitation, which is of interest in this study. we would also expect the rank of precipitation at a given point in space or time relative to the full data series to be reliably captured, even if there may be a bias in the absolute rainfall amount. as described below, this is exploited here through the use of percentile thresholds. note that throughout this paper we use the term rainfall when strictly we are referring to precipitation. specifically we are comparing model precipitation (including rain and snow) with hourly precipitation accumulations derived from radar reflectivity. in fact, the majority of precipitation over the united kingdom (particularly the southern regions considered in this study) is in the form of rain and not snow, but we do not explicitly distinguish these and include both

it is possible to sustain an urban region of almost 4 million residents in this desert setting because phoenix is reliant for water, not on local supplies, but on a vast water frontier, including the colorado river basin and the upstream watersheds of the salt and verde rivers. phoenix is so chronically short of precipitation that even sizable variation in local climatic conditions has a small effect on local water demand patterns because local demand is met by hydroclimate conditions in faraway places (e.g., the upper reaches of the colorado river basin). also relevant are effects of water policy and human behavior. the city had a water conservation program in effect during the study period, and we estimate that it reduced per capita water use by 15%. in addition, there are behavioral barriers that limit the responsiveness of water use to climatic conditions. to reduce outdoor water use during cooler, wetter periods, residents would need to adjust their mechanical irrigation systems or change their watering habits. in a study of the differences in water use between mesic and xeric applications in phoenix, martin (2001) found surprisingly little difference because residents with xeric designs do not adjust their water applications to account for seasonal changes in evapotranspiration. water use is inherently a human-dominated activity, and the critical issue is their perception of the landscape's needs and their ability to respond to that perception by changing their watering practices. climate and water use are linked by a complicated set of behavioral processes, about which we know relatively little, but which are crucial for the design of programs for the more efficient use of urban water in a desert city. acknowledgments. this material is based

rates of trees are determined as much by the genotypes that are planted on the site as by environmental conditions of the site itself (monserud rehfeldt, 1990). in the data we assembled, a sub-sample of only 35 of the populations was grown at each site, and this factor undoubtedly biased site means. second, tree growth is influenced by cultural conditions (e.g. density, spacing, vegetation control), biotic effects (e.g. insects, diseases), and abiotic factors (e.g. droughts, unseasonable frosts) for which our approach could not account. because of these sources of error and because of the general problem foresters historically have faced in developing site-specific relationships between height and age, perhaps it should be satisfying for errors of estimate to be only 10% (table 4). still, errors can be quite large (e.g. footner lake, table 4), but by limiting the discrepancy between the target-age and the age from which adjustments were made, they should be acceptable. our

homes are also desirable initiatives. federal, state, and local governments and various nongovernmental organizations can carry out these initiatives. as with current appliance labeling programs, federal agencies can develop and validate information about manufactured equipment and provide for its distribution by businesses to consumers. local governments and consumer organizations might be best for providing assurance about the quality of private energy auditors and the vendors and installers of household energy technology. but information alone--even much more useful information than is currently available--is not enough to induce behavior change, especially for many efficiency increases that involve significant initial monetary costs. there are major barriers to change, in addition to knowledge, which must be overcome, even among people who know which actions to take and would like to take them.23 for example, many equipment choices are shaped by intermediaries, such as builders and repair personnel who offer equipment options to households when their attention is focused on other things, such as kitchen design or the need to replace a water heater quickly. actions like upgrading home insulation and furnace and air-conditioning efficiency can yield major savings, but many households lack the funds needed to make the investments. renters cannot install such upgrades, and buyers of existing or newly built homes usually cannot choose the efficiency of heating and airconditioning equipment and insulation. even when people can afford major efficiency improvements, many may be inhibited by the logistical difficulties of arranging and scheduling the multiple contractors that may be needed to install space-conditioning equipment, insulation, and storm windows and doors. even lowor no-cost actions compete for people's limited time and attention. many believe that higher energy costs will cause households to economize by investing in energy efficiency. but households historically have not responded to price signals by making anywhere near all the energy-efficiency investments that are economically efficient. a major reason is the cost of information in time and effort required to estimate the actual returns on investment and to find the best products, vendors, lenders, and installers. a large organization can save enough money through energy actions to recoup the cost of hiring someone to find the most cost-effective savings opportunities, contract for the needed work, and ensure its quality. few households are in this position, and people know it intuitively. research conducted during the last u.s. energy crisis in the late 1970s demonstrates that the difficulty and inconvenience of identifying and taking effective energy-saving steps was a major barrier to action, even when utility companies offered to rebate households a majority of the cost of major home retrofits.24"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the

species' distribution long after the climate has become unsuitable for their successful reproduction (lamarche, 1973; pigott huntley, 1978). although there are now numerous reports of ongoing

used before considering the differences in variability, another question arises concerning the spatial grid for analysis. on a regular latitude-longitude grid, the grid cells in the polar regions have a far smaller spatial area than in the tropics. this could distort the analysis as smaller areas are likely to have larger variability solely due to their size and would artificially inflate toe at the poles, relative to tropical regions for instance. to examine this sensitivity we compare the interannual variability for the high northern latitudes using the native gcm data remapped on two different grids before analysis (figure 1). the median standard deviation of annual mean temperature on an icosahedral grid, with roughly equal areas in each grid cell (top left), and a regular latitudelongitude 5deg  5deg grid (bottom left) show very similar patterns, but there are two key points to note. first, there is a local minimum in sat variability in the vicinity of the north pole,

model to use. this is supported by the fact that for some climate indicators, such as precipitation, the predictions for certain regions vary dramatically across models. in the extreme, some models predict wetter summers for west africa and others predict drier summers--all using the same sres scenarios. one way to address the challenge of having to choose one gcm is to use model or ensemble averages (e.g., tebaldi and knutti 2007). this decreases the reliance on a single model. however, we believe it is important to either report the impacts for a number of climate models separately or to average them and indicate the variability in impacts across models. this is not difficult to do, and, given the low costs of data storage on personal computers and the access to free bandwidth for most academics, there is no reason not to. alternatively, if predicted changes within a study area vary more across than within climate models, then presenting a set of uniform scenarios might be

and cenozoic. in gastropods, adaptations of the shell to increasing predation pressure included increased spination, ribbing, and other defensive sculpture (vermeij 1977, 1987). the coleoid cephalopods--those forms, including octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, that lack an external shell--radiated beginning in the mesozoic, at least partially in response to the evolution of skeleton-crushing fish and marine reptiles. the slow-moving, externally shelled (ectocochleate) cephalopods--ammonoids and nautiloids--came under increasing predation pressure in nearshore environments. the faster-moving, fish-like coleoids radiated into a variety of niches in nearshore environments that had been vacated by extinction and ecological displacement of the ectocochleates (aronson 1991; packard 1972). octopods are predators of skeletonized invertebrates in shallow benthic communities at temperate and tropical latitudes, and they can be significant consumers in some situations. a direct consequence of increased predation, evident at multiple spatio-temporal scales, is a decline in the occurrence of dense populations of prey. dense populations of epifaunal, suspension-feeding ophiuroids are excluded from most modern coastal environments by predatory fish and crabs (aronson 1989). the primary predators of epifaunal ophiuroids living in dense populations are slow-moving invertebrates, including asteroids and polychaetes, and the low levels of predation the ophiuroids experience are reflected in low frequencies of sublethal arm damage (regenerating arms). on a macroecological-macroevolutionary scale, the diversification of durophagous predators during the mesozoic caused a global decline in the occurrence of these dense, low-predation ophiuroid populations in shallow-water habitats (aronson 1992). the mesozoic-cenozoic escalation in predation resulted from radiations in nearshore environments of taxa comprising the \"modern evolutionary fauna\" (sensu sepkoski 1991). the modern fauna, which is rich in mollusks, active bioturbators, and durophagous predators, replaced the \"paleozoic evolutionary fauna\" in coastal environments. the paleozoic fauna, rich in brachiopods, bryozoans, echinoderms, and other epifaunal, suspension-feeding taxa (as well as ectocochleate cephalopods), was progressively restricted to more offshore, deeper-water habitats as the modern fauna spread from onshore to offshore environments. durophagous predators originated onshore, largely eliminating epifaunal, suspension-feeding populations from soft-substratum habitats jablonski bottjer 1991, sepkoski 1991). from the jurassic onward, epifaunal suspension feeders on soft substrata were replaced by infaunal and more mobile epifaunal suspension feeders, giving onshore soft-substratum communities their modern, bivalve-dominated ecology (aberhan et al. 2006, bottjer"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Is there a wide amount of systematic knowledge about

predictions of many model-based analyses of climate-driven range changes. the apparent contradiction arises, among other factors, because current species distribution models lack the spatial and biological detail required to predict the persistence of populations at the local level, where fine-scale variation in landscape characteristics can buffer climates against change or provide alternative potential habitats (thuiller et al. 2008, willis baghwat 2009). the favorable effect of landscape heterogeneity on the historical long-term viability of relict populations highlights that future global warming does not necessarily doom climate relict populations to extinction. however, such populations are undeniably in a precarious situation and, hence, particularly susceptible to threats from warming and other drivers of global change. the current trend of rapidly rising global temperatures is now well established, and co2 emissions continue to rise faster than in the most pessimistic intergovernmental panel on climate change scenario (le quere et al. 2009). high latitudes are predicted to experience the strongest warming, with annual mean temperature possibly rising up to 8*c by 2100, although many temperate regions may expect increments between 2 and 5*c (ipcc 2007). hence, future broad-scale warming may relatively soon exceed small-scale temperature differentials in all but the most heterogeneous landscapes. although changes in precipitation are less easy to predict than those of temperature, it appears likely that precipitation will increase in many high-latitude areas but decrease in many warm temperate and subtropical regions (ipcc 2007). the global trends of temperature and precipitation and the greater spatial variability in precipitation trends also imply that not all regions that will become warmer will inevitably become dryer and more inhospitable. instead, some regions could maintain benign conditions and possibly even extend their role as centers of climate relict diversity in a world of rapid change (crimmins et al. 2011). the uncertainties about direct effects of future climate change are further exacerbated by diverse associated processes. for instance, rising co2 concentrations can lead to elevated plant growth through a combination of increased photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (poorter navas 2003). this implies that al relict plants threatened by increasing drought stress could benefit from rising co2 levels, whereas bl relicts could be compromised by resulting changes"}, {"qas": [{"question": "How

represent networking mechanisms crosscutting the protest ecology; how they embed and are embedded in various kinds of gatekeeping processes; and how they reflect changing dynamics in the ecology over

by the twittering within these ecologies. among other things, it appears that while the #thewave was successfully harnessed as an amplifying mobilization and publicity resource by a set of central

users into the analysis to ascertain who does what and helps create what kinds of resources. in many episodes of contentious action, moreover, a twitter hashtag is just one of many digital media

important in inducing more research into the development of \"clean\" (non-co2-emitting) technologies. there is overwhelming evidence that energy policies are of critical importance to the development of alternative technologies and are more effective in spurring technological advancement than subsidies. \"optimal\" policies will rely not only on climate sensitivity and the degree of climate

typically greater than zero, across future time periods. if the discount rate equals zero, then each time period is valued equally (case of infinite patience). if the discount rate is infinite, then only the current period is valued (case of extreme myopia). the discount rate chosen in assessment models is critical, since abatement costs will be typically incurred in the relatively near term, but the brunt of climate damages will be realized primarily in the long term. thus, if the future is sufficiently discounted, present abatement costs, by construction, will outweigh discounted future climate damages. in our recent research, we have found that incorporating large, non-linear damages (like \"surprises\") into our modeling considerably increases present \"optimal\" carbon taxes,

"the analogue method is also relatively data demanding; in the absence of surveillance systems, necessary human and environmental statistics may be hard to assemble. even so, catastrophic weather events (such as hurricane katrina) can trigger major shifts in policy and attitudes to risk despite being problematic to attribute to climate change. 5.4. trend extrapolation climate trend analysis can be a very appealing option, at least when extrapolating over the next few years. the attendant data and technical requirements are low compared with other scenario methods. but an assumption is made that recent climate behaviour is a sound basis for predicting the future. this may be reasonable for slowly varying components of the earth system such as sea level, or ocean temperatures which are highly correlated between successive years, even decades (section 7.2). regional climate trends that are largely driven by these elements may be robust in the near term (e.g. marengo and camargo, 2008). the trend need not be linear as testified by the extensive literature on climate cycles (e.g. becker et al ., 2008). however, trends are highly susceptible to false tendency (chappell and agnew, 2004; legates et al ., 2005). this can arise because data are not homogeneous, having been affected by a host of non-climatic influences such as encroachment of urban areas, changes in observer, instrumentation, monitoring network density, station location or exposure (kalnay and cai, 2003; davey and pielke, 2005). even if a physically plausible climate trend is found, the amount of explained variance may be low as in the case of regional rates of sea-level rise (plag, 2006). there is also no guarantee that a trend will persist, as evidenced by the abrupt changes in rainfall and atmospheric circulation of the last century (baines and folland, 2007; narisma et al ., 2007). apparent trends can also emerge because of the undue influence of a single outlier, particularly if it occurs towards the end of the record. multi-decadal variability in annual rainfall totals can cause the strength and/or even the sign of an extrapolated trend to change depending on the period and/or length of record chosen (figure 3). others have demonstrated that misleading trends can be an artefact of the statistical method used to divide data, such as percentile-based indices for temperature"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where does positive correlation is generally observed?", "id": 17630, "answers": [{"text": "a positive correlation is generally observed in cooler areas because

have focused on the impact of one weather variable in isolation, for example, regressing income only on precipitation shocks (miguel, satyanath, and sergenti 2004). while precipitation shocks are exogenous and hence a plausible instrument for income, it is important to note that to the extent that precipitation and temperature are correlated, the coefficient on precipitation will measure the combined effect of the two variables. this is particularly important in the climate change context if the estimated coefficient is used to estimate climate change impacts under a climate influenced by human activity. in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the effects of changes in precipitation and temperatures, which are historically correlated, both variables must be included in the regression equation, especially if the correlation is predicted to change in the future. to underline the importance of this observed correlation between different climate indicators, figure 1 shows the correlation coefficients between annual average temperature and total precipitation for each of the cru (version ts2.1) time series (ts) grid cells for the years 1960-1999. the map indicates clearly that the correlations vary greatly and that there are regions with both significant positive and significant negative correlation between precipitation and temperature. this implies that if one controls for only one of the two weather variables in a regression, the sign of the omitted variable bias will depend on the location under study. hot areas generally show negative correlation (as high as  0.7) because more precipitation and the associated evaporation results in cooling and lower average temperatures. in contrast, a positive correlation is generally observed in cooler areas because increased precipitation is associated with the import of warm and humid tropical air, and cloud cover keeps the underlying surface warmer. it is noteworthy that some large and not-so-large countries have areas of both negative and positive correlation (e.g., united states, russia, france, and spain)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the \"denial countermovement\"?", "id": 20909,

gender inequity is another important factor. in developing countries, women are among the most vulnerable to climate change; they not only account for a large proportion of the agricultural workforce

local sudden climate changes. eff orts to keep the adverse eff ects of climate change to a minimum should ensure that policies address issues of women's empowerment. individual assets that bring benefi ts to a woman's family and community, such as health and education, are easily attainable with good reproductive health. in particular, adequate birth spacing improves maternal and infant health and resilience, and contributes signifi cantly to women's ability to be economically productive. gender diff erences must be taken into account not just in terms of diff erential vulnerability but also as diff erential adaptive capacity. during a natural disaster, for example, women have a key role in protecting, managing, and recovering lost household resources, and often develop

determining whether small changes could really trigger substantial deglaciation is complicated enough. to compound this, there are no clear-cut records of marine ice sheet deglaciation for comparison, either on earth today or in the geological record. there have probably been many marine ice sheet deglaciations during the glacial cycles of the past 2 million years, but the geological record was bulldozed away as the ice sheets subsequently readvanced. only the record of the last deglaciation, since about 18,000 years ago, remains intact. this deglaciation caused two periods of global sea-level rise at rates far higher than those projected by the ipcc 2 ). however, most of that rise resulted from nonmarine ice sheets, and the sea-level curve on its own does not tell us to what extent marine ice sheets are unstable. indeed, there is still major uncertainty as to how much of the west antarctic ice sheet survived in recent interglacial periods that were globally warmer than

manipulating them. for example, enhancing endophytic colonization of plants offers prospects of enhanced abiotic and biotic tolerance, thus addressing multiple consequences of climate change in some

single fungicide (newton et al. 2009). however, if the challenge of increasing food production by 50% by 2050 can be met only by deploying cultivars with single or multiple resistance genes or by use of fungicides, it will be difficult to argue for an alternative approach that may not produce the highest attainable yields. there are many possible intervention points in the crop-pest / pathogen interaction, but decisions on which are to be prioritized will depend on a combination of their likely effects and the feasibility of manipulating them in a beneficial way that is both practical and acceptable. many treatments require initial investment in capacity and resource building referred to above, but if the potential benefits are great then this should guide investment. rankings are suggested in terms of high, medium or low in fig. 1, but their validity should be the focus of research policy debate. to be an effective input to policy debates, potential strategies must accompany cost estimates for various levels of adaptations. for instance, losses from phoma stem canker of oilseed rape caused by leptosphaeria maculans can be minimized with a 'low' adaptation strategy, which may require some farmer-led changes to adopt best management practices, but 'high'level long-term success will require significant changes and investments from the public and private sector, including

greater stocks in carbon. the ranges of temperate tree species can often be related to the length of the growing season (gdd5) and especially to absolute minimum temperature (woodward, 1987). in particular, the limit where broadleaved evergreen species are replaced by deciduous species is mostly climatically determined (woodward, 1987). however, the northern limit of mediterranean species in europe appears to be controlled by a combination of growing season length (or cumulated heat) and minimum winter temperature (woodward, 1987). climate change is likely to be reflected in these with

will affect forest productivity. hence, climate change may either enhance or mitigate fire risk, depending on whether fuels become dryer or wetter in each location and whether the increased warming causes a decrease in forest growth due to drying and increased fire frequencies, or an increase in growth due to warming, particularly at higher elevations. in fuel-limited ecosystems such as pinon-juniper and portions of the lower montane, fires are projected to become less frequent since these forests are likely to become less productive due to the warmer and possibly drier conditions. in forest types where fires are climate-limited, such as the upper montane and subalpine, fire frequency may increase as fuel production does not limit fire occurrence, and the fire season will increase in length and severity due to the lighter snowpack, earlier snowmelt, increased fire season length, and warmer temperatures. these changes will almost certainly overwhelm any possible increases in precipitation. we also assessed how each these projected trajectories in fire frequency and severity are likely to affect four key ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, runoff and water quality, air quality, and biodiversity. to some extent, impacts on ecosystem services can be influenced by future forest management alternatives. in pinon-juniper, management actions that prevent wildfire and increase fire suppression effectiveness would help to preserve woodland structure and its associated biodiversity, limit opportunities for annual grass invasion, maintain carbon stocks, and preserve water and air quality. in lower and upper montane forests, both prescribed fire and mechanical treatments have the potential to restore and maintain historical forest structure, promote native diversity, and lower the risk of severe air quality events. treated forests will store less carbon than untreated forests but, in montane ecosystems, should be more resistant to type conversion and the associated long-term loss of carbon stock. where feasible, prescribed fire in these forests may be the better choice for mimicking a natural process and promoting biodiversity, whereas mechanical treatments produce many of the benefits of prescribed fire without associated air quality concerns or the risk of fire escape. finally, in subalpine forests, allowing wildfires to burn where possible would mimic the natural fire process in these systems, benefit forest species, and maintain carbon stores. however, wildfires come with drawbacks in terms of potential increases in erosion and episodes of poor air quality. the feasibility of alternative fire management approaches will be greatly constrained by local considerations such as land ownership patterns, agency budgets and logistics, federal and local policies, tolerance of risk, and landscape context. further, our assessment shows that there tend to be tradeoffs among management alternatives, and that often no single management strategy will simultaneously optimize each of the four ecosystem services considered here. nevertheless, some management approaches may be more beneficial than others for conserving forest ecosystem services, and these will vary widely by forest type. key research needs include the relative roles of fuel versus climate limitation in the risk, occurrence, and severity of future fires across the forested zones of the rocky mountains, and how land management activities will interact with climate to impact forest ecosystem services in the region. despite remaining uncertainties, our current knowledge is sufficient to make informed management decisions that reasonably weigh the likely consequences of alternative management strategies under a future climate.

clearly, the decarbonisation of transport is not only essential to averting climate change, but has huge potential to improve public health. greenhouse-gas emissions from the transport sector can be reduced through a combination of trip substitution (eg, by telecommunications), improved technology and vehicle effi ciency, trip distance reduction, and a shift in modes of transport. on their own, technological developments will not be suffi cient because of predicted increases in motor vehicle sales and use. from a public-health perspective, modal shift off ers the greatest opportunity for benefi t. a shift to cycling, walking, and public transport also lowers energy use, which makes it easier to satisfy demands from non-fossil fuel sources such as biofuels. how achievable is this? much of the answer lies in the reconceptualisation and redesign of cities. half of the world's population now lives in cities. urban areas account for 78% of anthropogenic carbon emissions.9 the spatial design of cities is a key determinant of transport sustainability. high-density land use means shorter distances that can be covered readily by walking and cycling, and high-occupancy public transport. such measures need to be accompanied by policies that support walking and cycling, including legal priority, reallocation of street space and time, making trips more pleasant and attractive, and fi nancial incentives. cycling accounts for about a third of trips in some european cities57 but for less than 1% of trips in others. cycling also has considerable potential in low-income and middle-income cities where currently most journeys are by foot or public transport. financial incentives can include converting fi xed costs of motor vehicle use into distance-based charges that would send a more appropriate price signal and would discourage car use for short journeys. the expansion of car clubs as an alternative to car ownership, especially in urban areas, could contribute to reductions in unnecessary car use. although road building accounts for most transport-related international aid, the extent to which road construction benefi ts poor people remains open to question. most of the world's population will never own a car and local transport surveys show that road building fails to meet the transportation needs of poor people, for whom most trips are off -road by foot and over short distances, carrying small loads for subsistence needs.58 wheeled non-motorised modes such as bicycles and carts are substantially more energy effi cient than walking and headloading (ie, carrying items on one's head). increasing access to these methods of transport, combined with a substantial increase in the provision of foot and cycle infrastructure, would be a sustainable way to improve health and development. such transport can potentially reduce the large time burden of carrying water and fi rewood and hence free time for education, non-subsistence production, and other activities. beyond its eff ects on climate and aircraft noise, reducing air transportation is unlikely to bring important health co-benefi ts, with the possible exception of the role of aviation in the global spread of infectious diseases. substantial gains in the energy effi ciency of aviation are unlikely and, in any event, the growth in volume is predicted to far outweigh effi ciency gains in the medium term. aviation biofuels are under development but they would compete with other demands on bioenergy. current worldwide plans for expansion of aviation could well be unsustainable from a greenhouse-gas standpoint; effi cient, equitable, and eff ective methods of limiting the use of air travel will be needed. such methods would probably work best through economic incentives such as taxes, and by focusing initially on short-haul fl ights for which rail travel off ers a viable alternative."}, {"qas": [{"question": "How does leptospirosis enter the bloodstream?",

core age using spatial mean sediment accumulation rates, and in conjunction with an important compaction correction, this alternative is used at 21 core sites to construct a depth-derived age model spanning the last 780 kyr. the observed error in linear age-depth relationships is modeled as an autocorrelated stochastic process, and the a(17)age model is estimated to be accurate to within +-9 kyr. the depth-derived ages make no assumptions regarding orbital control, but agree with the orbitally tuned age models to within +-5 kyr, and thus within the error limits are consistent with one another. the remaining discrepancies, however, have important consequences. spectral analysis of eof1, using the a(17)age model, indicates significant spectral energy at combination tones of the 1/100 kyr and obliquity bands. there is also significant autobicoherence between each of these bands in eof1, all of which indicates a weakly nonlinear climatic response to obliquity forcing interacting with the quasi-100 kyr variability. these results may aid in differentiating between the various mechanisms proposed to explain glacial interglacial climate variability."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What

relevant data sets that can be used for the evaluation (eyring et al. 2005, see figure 1.2 ). the four ingredients are fundamentally interdependent and interactive and require as inputs, knowledge of

change. what is lacking from policy theories centred on discourse is consideration of how policy making takes place in the context of an existing material or physical infrastructure, which can exert significant influence on policy, structuring how problems are conceived and addressed. the materiality of policy change is particularly important for analysis of policy issues such as energy, which is dominated by a geographically-widespread, capital intensive, durable infrastructure, comprising a complex system of energy generation, transmission and distribution (graham and marvin, 2001; lovell, 2007a; smith et al., 2005). the existing physical infrastructure including, for example, power stations, distribution systems, buildings and meters, shapes the range of possible options for policy implementation. we need, then, to consider both the discursive and material dimensions of policy convergence, policy change and implementation. the concept of socio-technical regimes is relevant because of its emphasis on the interplay between human actors and technologies,iii and because of the notion that regimes become 'locked-in' to a particular technological trajectory over time, which shapes, and is shaped by, policy discourse (smith et al., 2005). we discuss in more detail below the ways in which materials and technologies also influence discourse because interests within the existing energy regime are able to structure the overall terms of policy debate."}, {"qas": [{"question": "why is Runoff a major component of the global water cycle?", "id": 14657, "answers":

clear. transmission is more sensitive to climatic factors, so the impact of climate change could be significant. a long-term increase in average rainfall might promote high mosquito populations in areas that are currently arid but reduce them where drought malaria is now the norm. lower rainfall could suppress transmission in arid areas, as appears to have happened in recent years on the southern edge of the sahara 105 ), but promotes drought malaria in wetter ones. increased temperatures could facilitate transmission in humid areas but reduce it if associated with low humidity. such changes could alter the relative abundance of local mosquito species, and natural selection could modify the species themselves. climate change would induce other ecologic changes, which could lead to agricultural and economic change that might increase or decrease transmission potential. the plethora of factors involved is complex, and the overall impact on endemicity and stability is even harder to predict. higher temperatures would probably raise the maximum altitude for transmission and could bring the disease back to major cities such as quito, ecuador, and mexico city, mexico, where it has not been seen for many decades. in most such situations, stability would remain low, so control measures should be relatively effective. however, at lower altitudes, which are at the present

transportation has greatly increased the mobility of many species. the of an anthropophilic mosquito to a new location could drastically alter transmission potential by altering stability. this has happened in the past--the worldwide distribution of ae. aegypti is perhaps the best example. climate change might affect the likelihood that such s would lead to disease transmission. yellow fever and dengue. rainfall is a major determinant of transmission in the forest cycle of yellow fever. climate models do not suggest major changes in equatorial regions of africa but indicate that rainfall might decrease toward the sahara. this could reduce the overall potential for enzootic activity, but the resultant reduction of immunity in the monkey population might exacerbate the rate of epizootic transmission during rainy episodes and enhance the likelihood of transfer of virus to the urban cycle. transmission would also be modified if climate change affected the monkey populations. transmission by peridomestic mosquitoes is often highly seasonal. the causes of this seasonality vary in different regions and in many cases are complex and poorly understood. thus, in areas where mosquitoes breed in stored water, their populations may be extremely high all year, yet peak transmission occurs in the rainy season. in many instances this probably occurs because it is also the hottest season and/or because the survival rate is greater at higher humidity. in other situations transmission may be enhanced during drought, when water storage becomes more important. however, the mere fact that transmission is seasonal does not imply that, for example, warmer seasons will produce higher rates of transmission. this is well illustrated by the record of dengue in puerto rico: there is no reason to suppose that climatic factors affect transmission rates of the four serotypes of this virus in different ways, but it is clear from figure 7 that the patterns of their incidence are not identical. immunologic history, expressed as the herd immunity, is presumably the dominant factor. moreover, a retrospective analysis of 33 years of monthly data on dhf incidence in bangkok, thailand, did not reveal any relationship between climate variables and the timing of epidemics 130 )."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is one of the most well-understood reponses of plants to elevated

that the frost boils had been in place for several millennia. the intermediate zone (see figure 7) reflects periodic and directed changes in the thaw-layer thickness (shur, 1988). the permafrost table is aggrading partly because loess and organic matter continue to accumulate on the soil surface and partly because the thickness of the thaw layer is decreasing as the site becomes more vegetated (ping et al. 2002). soil heat flux is reduced due to the insulation effect of the vegetation layer (ping et al. 2002) (see figure 6b). studies in northern yakutia have shown that the vegetation mat also affects the intermediate layer. shur (1988) found that the intermediate layer was less developed near the shore of the arctic ocean than in areas 100-200 km inland where the vegetation is more active. our comparisons of the intermediate layer in arctic alaska show similar large differences in ice content and cryogenic structure. a conceptual model of frost-boil formation along a climate gradient based on our observations from alaska, some reconnaissance studies in canada, and information from the literature, we have formed a general hypothesis regarding climate-frost-boil interactions. a simple conceptual model of the frost-boil system on zonal sites is shown in figure 12. the system consists of two spatial elements frost boil and inter-boil area. each element consists of three components the ice lenses, which are responsible for heave, the soils and the biogeochemical cycles within them, and the vegetation. the large bold arrows in figure 12 indicate interactions between the frost boil and the inter-boil area, namely via gravity (the flow of water and material from the frost boil to the inter-frost boil) and by cryosuction (movement of water from the inter-boil area to the frost boil during winter). within each element, the thin arrows indicate interactions between the components. the interactions between the soil and the ice lenses are primarily related to the influence of soil texture on ice segregation and the organic soil horizons on the insulation properties of the soil, which reduce heat flux into and out of the soil. effects of the ice lenses on the soil include changes to soil structure and chemistry, soil aeration, mineralization, and sorting of soil particles. the interactions between the soil and the vegetation include supply of

biological solids in the effluent can be responsible for the deterioration in the quantity of the effluent. based on this concept, various treatment systems incorporate a settling unit after the reactor in order to retain the biological solids and avoid that they reach the receiving body in the same concentration as found in the reactor. a system with a settling unit is shown in figure 9.11. the inclusion of a final settling unit results in a great improvement in the final effluent quality, thanks to the tendency presented by the bacteria responsible for the stabilisation of the organic

interannual climatic variability (ropelewski halpert, 1987). enso is exemplified by extensive warming of the normally cold waters of the central and eastern pacific ocean and a cooling in the western pacific ocean (rasmusson carpenter, 1982). el nino (en) is the term used to describe this periodic warming. the inhabitants of the peruvian coast noticed the appearance of this phenomena around christmas time, hence the name \"el nino\", in reference to the christ-child (enfield, 1993). the southern oscillation (so) is the atmospheric counterpart to el nino. the so describes the large-scale atmospheric seesaw pattern between the western and eastern pacific basins that drives the wind systems and ultimately precipitation patterns (diaz kiladis, 1993). given the sheer size of the pacific ocean basin, the dramatic change in the thermal east-west gradient of the sea surface temperatures results in the displacement and shifts in the normal zonal atmosphere-ocean circulation patterns (the so-called \"walker circulation\" or so) in the global tropics. sometimes the effects of these atmospheric circulation shifts extend into the subtropical northern hemisphere. these changes in the tropical ocean-atmosphere moisture energetics leads to anomalous climatic conditions, in particular dramatic shifts in precipitation patterns. regions that are typically dry receive above-normal

"answer_start": 576}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "racken in sweden. where formal institutional management does not occur, informal group action sometimes emerges to fill the void. evidence suggests that informal groups tend to emerge when there are: a small core group with shared values; a supportive external/policy environment; potentially equally distributed damages from non-participation in the group, for a summary of the literature on the emergence of collective action, see ostrom (1990) all these factors were present in the informal group that coalesced into the national hurricane committee in the cayman islands. changes are on-going in the cayman islands' government response to tropical storm risk. it is clear however, that there has been a rise in levels of individual cognition and there has been a collective group response in the form of the national hurricane committee. this in turn has contributed to a variety of institutional changes: in the legislation that exists, in the organisational structures that operate and in the individual behaviour of the agents who operate within the departments. what does this tell us about the ability of an institution to adapt to climate change? the three elements: attitudinal change, behavioural change and institutional change describe the processes through which institutions may need to pass to adapt to increased weather variability that can be expected with future climate change. 6. adapting to climate change while the ipcc (2001) states with high confidence that small low lying islands will be exposed to environmental hazards as a result of climate change, attributing current changes in environmental hazards and risks to climate change is premature as the science of climate change is not yet capable of doing this on a regional scale. waiting for climate science to confirm that short-term weather changes are attributable to long-term climatic change will reduce the time available and the set of options available to respond. the alternative is to accept what climate science currently tells us, that climate change will have impacts as predicted for small island states ipcc, 2001 ), and rely on persuasion to convince individuals to change their attitudes towards it, as a first step towards changing behaviour. 6.1. persuasion: information and knowledge about climate change in the cayman islands study, the majority of government agencies suggested that there is inadequate information available about the global consequences of climate change as well as the localised impacts in the cayman islands, see table 1 two clear causes appear to have led to this situation in the cayman islands. first are the mixed messages from the media. second is poor communication of the complex nature of climate change from climate scientists. the specific causes of the mixed messages and the lack of clarity about climate science were speculated upon by various government agents. many factors were perceived to be the cause, such as proximity to the us and hence a bias from us media as well as the difficult nature of climate science. several of those who did have access to information about climate change expressed confusion about the mixed messages that they were receiving. respondents commented that scientists did not seem to agree that climate change was happening, or what the likely impacts might be. further confusion arose in the understanding of the apparently conflicting information being presented about the impacts of climate change. 6.2. resilience: perceptions of vulnerability to climate change despite limited access to information, many respondents felt that some groups in the cayman islands could potentially be quite vulnerable to some climate change impacts. most respondents recognised that vulnerability stemmed from either existing social causes such as poverty (contributing to sub-standard housing and the spread of disease) or from geographical factors. most recognised that the geographically vulnerable are those who live in the coastal zone or low-lying flood-prone areas. most respondents believed that efforts should be made to assist those most likely to suffer the impacts of climate change in many countries climate change is often not considered an immediate or significant threat, o'connor et al., 1999 lazo et al., 2000 ), the same is true in the cayman islands. despite the awareness of vulnerability there was little recognition of the need to implement climate change response measures with any urgency. respondents provided a number of reasons for the low prioritisation of climate change risk, although broadly they can be grouped into reasons associated with lack of knowledge about climate change and climate change impacts, and a perception that prioritising climate change would mean de-prioritising other issues--the latter probably stemming from the former. table 2 shows in more detail the reasons government agents gave for not prioritising climate change. clearly, the fact that climate change is perceived as a low probability event; there is a lack of clear consistent information about climate change (refer back to table 1 ), and there is a general perception of local resilience to climate change impacts table 2 hinders placing climate change on the national agenda."}, {"qas": [{"question":

are matched with tree-ring records obtained from nonliving trees (stahle and cleaveland, 1992). overlapping chronologies from different sets of trees can sometimes be used to extend the record back in time. in this way, tree rings can provide hundreds, and in some cases more than a thousand, years of tree-ring chronologies. a statistical model describing the correlation between the instrumental record climate or streamflow record and the tree-ring chronologies can be developed using overlapping periods. for example, a regression model can be developed to estimate annual streamflow from tree-ring widths. this model is then applied to the preinstrumental record to estimate annual streamflow over the length of the tree-ring records. ideally, tree-ring chronologies should be developed for sites in all of the major runoff-producing areas of a river basin, because this is likely to maximize the fit of the regression model (meko and others, 199\\\\x04). principal components analysis and canonical correlation analysis are sometimes used, particularly when multiple tree-ring sites and (or) multiple hydroclimatic records are used (loaiciga and others, 1993). the uncertainty in the reconstructed record can be estimated by the standard error of prediction. however, if the tree-ring chronology for the extended period includes values that were not observed in the calibration period, extrapolation of the regression model into this range of values will introduce additional uncertainty into the reconstructed time series. another source of uncertainty that may affect the time series is the number of trees available to create different periods of the tree chronology. the number of trees typically decreases toward the beginning of a chronology, increasing the uncertainty in that part of the reconstructed record (meko and others, 199\\\\x04). cook and others (2007) and stahle and others (2007) describe the use of tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct approximately 1,000 years of drought history over most of north america. they used tree rings to reconstruct the palmer drought severity index (pdsi), an index calculated from instrumental records of precipitation and temperature as a measure of available soil moisture. their analysis shows that past \"megadroughts\" eclipse those in much of the instrumental record in terms of duration and severity. this is consistent with woodhouse and overpeck's (1998) analysis, which used historical documents, archaeological remains, lake sediments, and geomorphic data in addition to tree rings, to reconstruct 2,000 years of drought history in the central united states. eolian sediments (dunes), lake sediments, riverine cave sediments, and ocean sediments can also be used as proxies to reconstruct hydroclimatic information. while they do not allow the accuracy and resolution that is possible with tree-ring reconstructions, different inferences may be drawn from different proxies, giving a more complete picture of past drought events (woodhouse, 2004). climate information for periods prior to the instrumental record can be reconstructed using historical information and proxy data from tree rings, sediment, and other sources. these reconstructed time series are generally less precise than the instrumental record, with varying uncertainties and time resolution, depending on the technique used; however, they can provide useful information on the range of variability that has been seen at a particular location. paleorecords can provide a much better record of variability than is typically available from the instrumental record. for some variables, paleoclimate reconstructions have been estimated millions of years into the past. generally, the further back in time reconstructions are attempted, the less accurate they are. water managers have varying planning horizons, but they are generally less than 30-40 years, and the large variations that may have occurred over the past millions of years have limited relevance. water managers are primarily interested in scenarios that are consistent with current climate and natural variability. holocene records (from approximately the last 10,000 years) provide a greater range of variability than observed in the instrumental record, as well as different sequencing of events, and they allow for reasonable estimates of uncertainty that can be incorporated into subsequent sensitivity analysis. historical documents, such as newspaper articles, diaries, and letters, sometimes contain useful information about notable climate events such as floods or prolonged droughts. in some cases, regular records of meteorological conditions can be found. for example, both thomas jefferson and james madison kept meteorological diaries in the late eighteenth century (druckenbrod and others, 2003). these historical records can be used to supplement the other techniques described below."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What test was

reasons why ocean models are of primary importance for climate science. this chapter also helps to motivate the more fundamental, and by necessity mathematical, development presented in subsequent chapters. part 1 begins the main part of the book by focusing on the equations describing stratified fluid dynamics on a rotating sphere. chapter 2 introduces some physical ideas underlying a continuum description of the ocean fluid. it also highlights common approximations made in ocean climate models. chapters 3 and 4 derive the hydrodynamical equations of the ocean fluid. chapter 5 presents aspects of ocean energetics and thermo-hydrodynamics. chapter 6 presents some mathematical results applicable to a generalized vertical coordinate description of the ocean. this chapter also highlights some deficiencies inherent in the different model classes now in use for simulating the ocean. the equations described in part 1 offer a precise mathematical description of a particular realization of the ocean fluid. to make use of this description requires an infinite level of knowledge about the ocean's state, i.e., the positions and velocities of each fluid parcel, and full information about forces acting on the parcels. in practice, we are always faced with less than infinite information in both space and time. hence, it is necessary to derive alternative equations via a coarse-graining procedure. that is, we need to determine approximate, averaged, or mean field equations for the coarsened ocean fluid. part 2 presents three chapters illustrating various issues with

opportunistic for sdms in applied ecological studies. using all available bioclimatic variables, instead of a tailored selection, increases the possibility of over-fitting species distribution models, and may lead to an overestimate of range reduction and the likelihood of a forecasted extinction under climate change 16 ]. the importance of variable selection in determining the output of sdm depends on the characteristics of the species modelled. for example, variable selection may be less important for long-lived sedentary plant species such as the king billy pine but can be very important for mobile species with specific biological characteristics or requirements, such as the ptunarra brown butterfly. for the butterfly, inclusion of different variables in the model led to widely divergent projected futures for end-of-century, ranging from close to no locations with a suitable climate 61 to maintenance of the current range. biological knowledge of the species can help in choosing variables amenable to ecological interpretation. ideally, modellers, species experts and conservation practitioners should work as a team to build the sdm, interpret results and consider conservation management responses. however, such interdisciplinary exercises are uncommon and often little is known of the species' biology and ecology as they relate to climatic factors. in these cases, a range of statistical diagnostics can provide some guidance as to relative model performance, but there is no objective method for identifying the 'best' sdm when projecting into the future. statistical methods of model selection alone are not sufficient to accept or reject a model, as different performance indices (e.g. auc, aic, bic) can give conflicting rankings 62 ]. furthermore, statistical models are a measure of internal model performance, not a measure of ecological validity. the accuracy with which the current distribution is represented by a sdm is an important consideration. however, an accurate fit with current distributions does not guarantee that the prediction of future potential distribution will be accurate. the underlying statistical relationship between the climatic variables and the distribution of the species may change due to, for example, nonlinear functional responses of the species or indirect impacts such as an altered fire regime. considering the extent to which a sdm is attempting to project into novel climatic conditions is also an important consideration in model evaluation. predicted potential distribution maps with large

canada. in spite of growing protection organizations, the expanding use of canadian forests for both industrial and recreational purposes resulted in large increases in both the number and impact of forest fires across the country. fire protection capability expanded and modernized over the ensuing decades, and canada has evolved into a recognized world leader in many aspects of fire management, assisted in no small way by a close connection to a growing forest fire science capacity, particularly within the federal forestry department. nevertheless, despite major progress in predicting, detecting, and controlling fires, canadian fire management agencies recognize quite clearly that there are physical and economic limits to further control fire and have come to realize that increasing fire suppression expenditures lead to decreasing marginal returns in terms of escaped fires or area burned. in addition, there are a number of emerging pressures that are expected to, in the very near future, greatly influence fire management practices in canada. these include climate change, an expanding wildland-urban interface, declining forest health and productivity, competition for the forest land base, growing public awareness and expectations, and a declining forest fire management infrastructure and capability. russian forestry evolved from german models and always included a strong program of fire protection. recognition that protection of the vast russian boreal zone would require an aircraft-based reconnaissance and suppression capacity led to the beginning of a formal aerial protection program in the early 1930s (stocks conard, 2000). this program expanded dramatically after world war ii as surplus aircraft and demobilized military paratroopers became available. avialsookhrana, the federal forest protection service, began using helicopters extensively in the 1970s. by the early 1990s, russia had created the largest firefighting system in the world, and this system was largely successful in reducing area burned, particularly around settlements. however, large fires were still commonplace and vast areas of the russian taiga burned almost annually. following the collapse of the soviet system in 1991, fire control budgets were severely reduced, and fire protection in russia has become largely ineffective. as a result, severe fire seasons with very large areas burned have become commonplace in russia, particularly in siberia, over the past 15 years. despite the fact that russia currently receives huge revenues from the global export of its natural resources, none of this is being used in improving forest protection. in addition, forest exploitation is rampant, further exacerbating an already critical fire problem (goldammer, 2006)."},

also demonstrated that the assumed rate of decarbonisation in 35 of the scenarios agreed poorly with reality in 2000-2010, as the rapid growth of the chinese and indian economies actually had increased the global carbon and energy intensities. smil (2008) also pointed out how the scenarios ignored several key facts about global energy and its future, more specifically the jevons paradox

shift of the intertropical convergence zone (itcz) in the tropical north pacific and a southward migration of the north atlantic itcz during boreal winter. the trend in the northern hemisphere land

temperatures.65 the key task, attuned to local culture and economy, is to fi nd ways of lessening adverse health risks from changes in food yield, quality, and accessibility. although industrialised and intensive agricultural production has helped to boost food output, it has also undermined the integrity of ecosystems by, for example, impairing nutrient cycling in soils, overusing pesticides, and disrupting natural pollination. such sustained high agricultural output has also depended on fossil fuel use to generate fertilisers. agricultural mismanagement can also result in salination and water-logging of soils, and in land degradation and soil erosion.132,133"}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the purpose of undertaking agricultural adaptation", "id": 13678, "answers": [{"text": "the

it is particularly important to align the scales (spatial, temporal, and sectoral) and reliability of the information with the scale and nature of the decision. for example, short-term climate adaptation by farmers may be accomplished by taking into account local climate trends if there is a strong correspondence between these trends and projected climate changes, or it may be via climate forecasting at scales from daily to interannual. however, farmers may find limited utility in long-term projections of climate, given the high uncertainties at the finer spatial and temporal scales at which their decisions are made (11). in contrast, the general trends at larger time and spatial scales able to be more reliably projected with current climate models may be quite useful for input into policy and investment analyses, provided potentially critical factors are incorporated such as changes in climate extremes (12). a significant benefit from adaptation research may be to understand how

the climate impacts of converting the amazon rainforest into pastures or soybean croplands using simulated land cover maps from a businessas-usual scenario of future deforestation. the results for

increase in albedo and reduction of evapotranspiration associated with the lower surface aerodynamic roughness, the lower leaf area, and the shallower rooting depth of pasture and soybean cropland compared with forest. the relationship between simulated precipitation and deforestation shows an accelerating decrease of rainfall for increasing deforestation for both classes of land use conversions. the reduction in precipitation in this region is more evident when deforestation exceeds 40% of the original forest cover, and this reduction in precipitation occurs mainly during the dry season. when we analyze the average change in precipitation for the entire amazon (not presented here) we find the same tendency: reduction in precipitation in dry season of about 16% for the case of replacing the entire forest by pasture, and 24% for replacing by soybean. the reduction in precipitation can create favorable conditions to potentially alter the structure of the forests, and lead to a process of savannization, as suggested by some studies [e.g., nobre et al. 1991; oyama and nobre 2003; hutyra et al. 2005]. the ecosystems of amazonia are subjected to various, but interconnected,

this process at a corporate level. however, this does not mean that developing fsas to adapt to climate change merely occurs at mne headquarters and is implemented uniformly throughout the global organization. as stated in the the role that climate change plays in mne strategy is determined by a broad conglomerate of factors involving governmental as well as societal and market forces, working at different geographical levels. there may well be particular geographical factors that are conducive to a climate-induced change in fsas, but this also means that it benefits the mne at a specific location only. in other words, mnes not only have the option to develop or change fsas internally, but can also optimize their fsa-csa configurations by taking specific conditions of home and host countries into account, such that csas form the starting point for fsa development (rugman verbeke, 1992). climate change thus adds new dimensions to what regionalization or globalization in terms of production and/or sales might mean for an mne and its network, regarding possible spillovers of such concerns to other (core) activities and other locations, and how organizational responses are coordinated and controlled (cf. rugman verbeke, 2004). climate change creates a geographically dispersed and moving target; while it may form a threat in one location, it can be an opportunity in another. regardless of whether regional or local characteristics are seen as a potential advantage or disadvantage, liability or risk, geographical differences are something to be faced by mnes and those firms that excel in doing this, are the ones most likely to develop climate-induced fsas. hence, learning from climate change does not merely mean that mnes need dynamic capabilities to cope with technological change; constantly rejuvenating fsas by being responsive to a wide range of climate change-relevant csas is what gives them an edge vis-a-vis competitors. for example, mnes operating outside their home regions, upstream and/or downstream, may have difficulty in accommodating host-country concerns and approaches on climate change appropriately, often referred to as

and cannot therefore be effective in either reducing greenhouse emissions, or upholding principles of gender equitable sustainable development (dennison, 2003). as the box below illustrates, women may in some cases be more likely than men to support or accept progressive and significant climate change mitigation and adaptation policies - so there is also a very strategic rationale for their greater involvement in policy and decision-making processes. women's risk perception and policy formulation - a northern perspective women and men perceive risks differently, including in relation to climate change. women are more sensitive to risks and less likely to perceive governmental policies and measures taken to deal with climate change as sufficient. women also seem more prepared for behavioural changes than men, as \"fewer women than men believe that science and technology will solve environmental problems without our having to change our lifestyles. they also rate more highly the influence

most \"natural allies\" of those promoting progressive and significant climate change mitigation and adaptation policies (see hemmati, m., 2005). as noted above, recent research by the institute of development studies and plan international has also pointed to the marginalisation of children's voices in household, community and national decision-making relating to climate change, particularly in disaster risk reduction (drr) (mitchell etc al. forthcoming 2008). children are assumed to have no role to play in reducing the risk of disasters. yet research carried out in el salvador and new

concerns the popular view of science as projected by users of scientific information and by those producers of primary science on climate issues who have chosen also to act as advocates and activists. they employ a 'deficit model' of science. the expert scientist pours knowledge into the ignorant and passive heads of the public and their representatives. their deficit is remedied. they trust the expert's superior knowledge and qualifications and the scientist then leverages that power to instruct further the ignorant public and to delineate the correct actions to remedy the situation which the expert has described. hulme documents the special role of this sort that was played by the met office's \"dangerous climate change\" conference of 2005, held at the behest of prime minister blair's office ahead of the gleneagles g - 8 summit, and the associated role of the then chief scientific adviser to hm government.34the same model was endlessly repeated in the pre 17thnovember 2009 assertions of the unimpeachability of the international panel on climate change (ipcc), usually citing percentages of agreement or numbers of scientists agreeing. journalists placed implicit and in retrospect excessive trust in such deficit - model statements. their sense of betrayal, to be detected among many observers of the climate debate after the 17thnovember watershed, perhaps explains the ferocity with which the climate science community is being investigated by the media now. in fact, there is another sort of insight about the popular model of science that is important. this is the way in which the role of value judgements can be unhelpfully obscured. in his 2007 book on science policy, roger pielke jr presents the issue in the following way. he notes that the prediction of an imminent tornado is judged to be a sufficient basis for action without reference to other criteria. it is solely an issue of trust in the authoritativeness of the source. this trust results not because values are not present, but rather simply because the value issues are not in dispute no one wants to die because of being in the path of a tornado that everyone agrees is heading in their direction. in contrast, a person's position on the question of abortion may be informed by medical expert knowledge, but it is well understood that religious and other views may play a greater a role in how people think about the issue. the consequence of the misunderstanding of science by the 'deficit' model, pielke suggests, is that climate change policy, which with its multiple framings is more similar to peoples' views on abortion, has been commonly presented as if it were akin to the value - consensus context of the tornado prediction. in turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be 'science driven' as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus.35rather, as we have"}, {"qas": [{"question": "How

studies and integrated assessment models provide evidence that climate change will affect agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food quality, and, notably, food safety. low-income producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks. some synergies among food security, adaptation, and mitigation are feasible. but promising interventions, such as agricultural intensification or reductions in waste, will require careful management to distribute costs and benefits effectively."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has been incluided in the Working Group III's report?", "id": 5486, "answers": [{"text":

23) and can cause overor underestimates in our results. for example, false assumptions of climatic intolerance due to modeling only the realized niche, and therefore ignoring species interactions and other nonclimatic determinants of range boundaries, may increase the projected distance a species needs to travel to suitable climate and cause overestimates of the percentages of species unable to track climate change (e.g., our results in southern florida). in addition, correlative models have inherent uncertainties associated with their inability to project the suitability of novel climates and to account for evolution. also, range expansions may occur from small populations that are already closer to regions of future suitable climate, but that are absent from our projections due to the coarse resolution of range maps (7). conversely, the assumption that the climate throughout a species distribution is suf fi cient for persistence of all populations of that species will lead to underestimates of percentages of mammals unable to reach suitable climate because current distributions may not exist in equilibrium with current climate or species may be locally adapted to speci fi c climates within their distributions. the bioclimatic model projections in our study also contain uncertainty because they are based only on climatic variables and derived from one type of bioclimatic model. incorporating vegetation or soil types as predictor variables or using alternate bioclimatic models would likely result in different projections of species distributions and possibly in greater or lesser velocities of climate change (24, 25). additionally, bioclimatic model projections contain inherent uncertainty due to their dependence on output from uncertain climate models (23). however, the patterns produced by our models are geographically and taxonomically very similar across the 10 climate-change scenarios used in our models si appendix ). therefore, our

learning literature suggests that for adaptation to occur, a sensitive organisation needs to receive and understand signals about a change in the condition they face. while most interviewees were aware that the global climate is expected to change, direct signals of climate change experienced in businesses activities and performance were rare and tended to be hard to interpret. an interviewee of company f, for example, reported subtle changes in their waste-water business due to what he referred to as 'weather change', but he was unsure whether these could be attributed to climate change. company a had experienced severe flood damage to one of its new developments in the winter 2000/2001. this was taken as a signal of higher risks of riverine flooding in the future, but little further assessment was done of the causes of this possible trend. other house builders reported a decreasing number of frost days bringing fewer work stoppages during winter and increasing attention to the risk of skin cancer due to outside working. overall, direct signals of climate change were both routine (the continuous monitoring of water resources by water companies) and ad hoc (flooding of a site under development by company a). in the housing sector these signals were usually perceived as being specific, rather than being interpreted as indications of a wider phenomenon of climate change.

closely interlinked with focal development areas such as infrastructure, agriculture and health, and there is a large potential for integrating climate adaptation measures into already existing and on-going projects and planning efforts. in the case examples examined, integrating climate change adaptation could be done with a low cost. climate change mainstreaming has been addressed in a pragmatic way in the paper using a short list of sustainable development indicators to evaluate economic, social, and environmental dimensions of climate change adaptation. the approach is stepwise and starts with modelling of climate conditions, variability and change, which subsequently are linked to development policies and indicators. this is followed by an identification of adaptation measures and assessment of these compared with unmitigated climate change impacts. the methodological approach is further illustrated in relation to three case studies from mozambique and tanzania. the mozambique example is related to infrastructure planning where existing and future highways can be damaged by increasing magnitude and intensity of floods. the damages will increase maintenance costs and can cause temporary disruptions on the roads. the highways could potentially be less vulnerable to climate change if adaptation measures, in terms of drainage systems, stronger foundations and bridges and alternative routes, were taken into consideration. based on experiences from previous flooding events in 2002 in mozambique and internationally available data on adaptation measures, it is shown that there could be significant benefits associated with more climate safe road design. rain water harvesting for agricultural irrigation have been considered as a case example for tanzania, based on the expectation that agriculture in many parts of the country will need increased irrigation with climate change. the development impacts of enhanced rainwater harvesting capacity for rice paddy production are considered based on a previous study from the dodoma region of tanzania. climate change was not taken into consideration in this study however, an extrapolation of the cost and benefit results of enhanced irrigation measures in this case suggest that the rainwater harvesting systems are very effective in supporting crop yields and economic performance. increased malaria protection in tanzania through increased distribution of bed nets has been considered as an adaptation measure against an expected increase of the incidence of malaria associated with climate change. the costs of malaria net distribution and information programmes are measured against avoided treatment costs and reduced sickness and mortality, and it is concluded that almost 4000 lives could be saved and 800.000 cases could be averted annually by distributing 800,000 additional net to cover the whole population in tanzania. such a program is considered to be very economic attractive and the net benefits were assessed to be 300,000 usd per year. despite the potential large benefits of mainstreaming climate adaptation into malaria programmes, it should be noted that malaria protection planning in a climate context is as complex as in general malaria planning and there is no easy solutions in establishing not only knowledge but also utilization of interventions such as itns. the approach in this way illustrates how sustainable development indicators and climate change can be linked, and quantitative information is provided about key linkages and impacts. a number of broader social impacts could be covered in more detail than it has been possible in the current case examples, and this could potentially further strengthen the argument that climate change adaptation measures could be important measures in reducing the vulnerability of the poor. this is the case because climate risks could be reduced for a relatively low cost in the examples, and because not coping with these could further enhance vulnerabilities in terms of poor health conditions for woman and children, weak infrastructure and flooding risks, and crop losses due to high variability of precipitation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are the responses of health threats through changing patterns of disease due to insect-borne infections?", "id": 4327, "answers": [{"text": "various

other end of the spectrum, development activities relating to education, gender equality, and governance reform are much less directly affected by climatic circumstances. in principle, the sectoral selection should include all development activities that might be designed differently depending on whether or not climate risks are taken into account. therefore, the label \"affected by climate risks\" has two dimensions. it includes projects that are at risk themselves, such as an investment that could be destroyed by flooding. but it also includes projects that affect the vulnerability of other natural or human systems. for instance, new roads might be fully weatherproof from an engineering standpoint (even for climatic conditions in the far future), but they might also trigger new settlements in high-risk areas, or it might have a negative effect on the resilience of the natural environment, thus exposing the area to increased climate risks. these considerations should be taken

exacerbating factor in the districts for vulnerability. on the other hand, households living in the lowland areas were vulnerable to drought, disease outbreaks and alien weeds. however, when comparison is made between three agro-ecological zones in the study area, lowland was not vulnerable because of better experience of operating agricultural activities under stressful conditions, relatively bigger size of farm land with optimal number of farm plots, better access to credit, moderate slope of farm lands, better fertility level of farmlands, better adaptation to changing climatic conditions and relatively access to early warning information. the resilience levels of farm households living in the same area differ based on certain socio-economic and natural factors attributable to lives and livelihood of the farmers. the capacity to bounce back during and after climate change induced shocks depends on a number of households' characteristics, institutional arrangements, social networks, economic capacity and natural setting. maintaining productive assets from deterioration during shocks, accessing to irrigation, investing on farmland, improving the fertility level of farms through usage of organic processes, having preparedness, diversifying income sources and participating in local institutions are some of the households' action that can build their resilience to climate change impacts. organizational responses from government and development actors through creation of access to market, access to farm loans, improving educational level, and

metres to several tens of metres per year, resulting in an increase in the number and size of glacial lakes and a concomitant increase in the threat of glacial lake outburst floods (glofs). such climate changes have ultimate effects on the life and property of the mountain people living downstream. while the effect of human activity on global climate is still being hotly debated, the retreat of glaciers in the himalaya is compelling evidence of the need for action on climate change. approximately 15,000 glaciers (covering an area of 33,340 sq.km), and 9000 glacial lakes throughout bhutan, nepal and pakistan, as well as selected river basins in china and india were documented in a baseline study conducted earlier by icimod, unep, and the asia pacific network for global change research (apn). twenty-one glof events have adversely affected nepalese territory in the recent past and to date over 200 potentially dangerous glacial lakes have been documented across the himalayan region. these facts underline the urgent need to enhance scientific knowledge of glacier environments by continuously monitoring glaciers and glacial lakes, carrying out vulnerability assessments, implementing mitigation and adaptation mechanisms, and developing a glacial lake outburst flood (glof) early warning system. regional co-operation to develop a coordinated strategy to deal with trans-boundary issues related to the impacts which can occur as a result of climate change is also required. this publication focuses on the effects of climate change on glaciers and glacial lakes in two hotspots of glacial activity in the himalaya: the dudh koshi sub-basin of nepal and the pho chu sub-basin of bhutan. both these basins have witnessed devastating glof events in the recent past. the glofs at dig tsho in 1985 (nepal) and luggye tso in 1994 (bhutan) are considered 'textbook' case studies of glof events and have drawn the attention of researchers world-wide. a multi-media cd-rom is being prepared as a companion to this book and will be helpful in raising awareness about the sensitivity of climate change to policyand decision-makers, the concerned scientific community, and the general public. these materials will be helpful in designing mitigation measures to help safeguard human lives and valuable infrastructure in hazardous river valleys. while this and other activities are helping to raise awareness of the risks posed by glofs, it will also be essential to replicate these studies and to continue to extend them systematically to include other high-risk areas in the himalaya. the scientific modelling approaches and the empirical methods discussed here are both needed first steps that will be valuable in refining and scaling up this type of investigation to other himalayan hot-spots. what is needed now is urgent action by the international community to help develop even better scientific understanding of the consequences of global climate change and to take

fire-specific biophysical variables including fire danger and water balance metrics were considered in addition to standard climate variables of monthly temperature, precipitation and drought indices to explicitly determine their optimal capacity to explain interannual variability in area burned. biophysical variables tied to the depletion of fuel and soil moisture and prolonged periods of elevated fire-danger had stronger correlations to area burned than standard variables antecedent to or during the fire season, particularly in forested systems. antecedent climate-fire relationships exhibited inter-region commonality with area burned in forested lands correlated with winter snow water equivalent and emergent drought in late spring. area burned in non-forested lands correlated with moisture availability in the growing season preceding the fire year. despite differences in the role of antecedent climate in preconditioning fuels, synchronous regional fire activity in forested

surprisingly the most sophisticated was that of the baroque period in the late eighteenth century, since when the passive design skills of the master builders of the region appear to be in decline.

obsolete. projections of human-induced climate changes and evidence of past rapid climate shifts indicate that patterns of biodiversity may change over landscape scales over time frames as short as decades. new, dynamic conservation strategies are needed to accommodate the natural and human-induced changes in climate that present evidence suggests are inevitable. at the same time, future climate change must be constrained. if it is not, even expanded, dynamic conservation efforts will ultimately be overwhelmed. the stakes are high. the political barometer of average global temperature increase in 2100 masks the magnitude of possible effects on biodiversity in both time and space. changes in temperature over continental areas will be higher, possibly more than double the global average in some areas, because sea surface temperatures are lower and change less. the end-of-the-century global average misleads in time because, under present greenhouse-gas emissions trends and most reduction scenarios, warming will continue well beyond 2100. biodiversity will have to cope with the ultimate temperature change, not just the end-of-the-century political yardstick. of course, climate change is much more than just temperature change, so biodiversity also will be confronted with changing rainfall patterns, declining water balances, increased extreme climate events, and changes in oscillations such as el nino. a two-pronged response is required. first, those concerned about biodiversity need to become an important voice in the global warming debate. biodiversity scientists have strong reason to become an active constituency and to advocate that global greenhouse-gas emissions be reduced in real terms. second, we must use our skills to develop conservation

tussock grassland communities. this high diversity in habitats compared with the closed forest at lower altitudes and the monotonous heath lands at higher altitudes - leads to a high diversity in species numbers. this trend is enhanced by the occurrence of fire-tolerating species, which show the same bimodal altitudinal distribution with a gap in the wettest central forest parts where fires are uncommon. they can therefore be regarded as fire indicators. 7.5.2 influence of fire on regeneration, composition and structure of forests forest fires are frequent in the subalpine zone and also, less frequent in the submontane and forest fires are frequent in the subalpine zone and also, less frequent in the submontane and lower montane zone between 1300 and 2000 m above sea level (asl). fires in the submontane and lower montane forests are mostly set by people. in these forests, fire changes species composition and structure of the tree as well as the herb layer (hemp, a. in press). this is of major importance for forest regeneration, as the dense cover of bracken impedes the sprouting of trees. in the subalpine forests between 2800-3000m asl fire causes sharp discontinuities in the floristic composition and structure26. once erica excelsa has established, regeneration of a broad-leaved forest becomes more and more improbable (hemp beck 2001). if the frequency of fire becomes too high it degrades erica excelsa forests into bush lands in which e. excelsa is substituted by e. trimera and e. arborea this erica bush extends between"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Say Pacific
